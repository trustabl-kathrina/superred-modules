## What it does

Safety training is heavily biased toward English and other high-resource
languages. This optimizer asks the attacker LLM to translate the objective into
a **low-resource or non-Latin-script language** (Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Bengali,
…), then appends an instruction to reason in that language and translate the
final answer back to English. Each candidate translation is gated by a refusal
(compliance) check and a "did it actually translate" check before being sent,
retried up to `max_retries` times, falling back to the original goal.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/multilingual"
```

## Usage

```python
from multilingual_optimizer import MultilingualOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: MultilingualOptimizer()              # auto-select language
optimizer_factory = lambda: MultilingualOptimizer(language="Zulu")
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `language` | `None` | a specific target language, or auto-select a low-resource one |
| `max_retries` | `5` | gated translation attempts before falling back to the goal |
