"""Thread-bridge between the vendored (synchronous) SEATS engine and anonframework's
asynchronous, budget-enforced :class:`~anonframework.core.llm.LLMClient`.

The vendored upstream code calls its rewriter/attacker/judge model through a
synchronous ``client.chat(messages, model=..., temperature=..., max_tokens=...)``
that returns the assistant text as a string. anonframework instead hands the optimizer
an *async* ``self.llm.complete(messages, **kwargs)`` whose model, API base, and key
are locked by the controller and whose cost is capped per task.

:class:`VendorLLMBridge` is a drop-in for the upstream client: it exposes the exact
``chat`` signature, so every vendored function runs **byte-identically** against it.
The optimizer invokes each vendored LLM-using helper on a worker thread
(``asyncio.to_thread``); ``chat`` bridges each call back onto the event loop with
``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and blocks that worker thread (not the loop) for the
reply. ``model`` and ``temperature`` are dropped (locked by the experiment; never
sent, per anonframework convention).

Budget is the one thing the transport must NOT swallow: every vendored call site
wraps ``client.chat`` in ``except Exception`` and falls back. So a genuine
``BudgetExhaustedError`` is re-raised as :class:`_BudgetSignal` and the no-LLM
(noop client) case as :class:`_NoLLMSignal` — both ``BaseException`` subclasses,
which slip past ``except Exception`` and surface at the ``to_thread`` boundary in
the optimizer, where they are unwrapped. Ordinary transport failures stay
``Exception`` so the vendored fallbacks (rule-based operators, ``[goal]``
decomposition, probe follow-ups) fire exactly as upstream intends.
