"""Provenance + byte-identical asset pins for the vendored SEATS engine.

The upstream "Attack Anything" (SEATS) reference code was provided by the user as
an anonymous, under-review submission (README author "Anonymous", note "Under
review"). It carries no LICENSE file and no public repository or commit SHA; the
user asserts it is Apache-2.0, and it is redistributed here under that license
(see ``LICENSE`` + ``NOTICE``). Because there is no upstream commit to pin, the
byte-identical claim is anchored to a SHA-256 of each vendored file, captured at
vendoring time from the provided source. ``tests/test_assets_byte_identical.py``
recomputes and compares these, so any accidental edit to ``_vendor/`` fails loudly.
