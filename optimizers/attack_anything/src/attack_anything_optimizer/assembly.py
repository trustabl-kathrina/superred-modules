"""The RDRT-lineage assembly step.

anonframework's SecurityClaim judges each run's transcript for the full goal, but a
decomposition attack elicits the goal's pieces across separate innocuous
conversations, so no single sub-task run contains the assembled harm. The
standalone RDRT attacker (which the SEATS engine descends from) resolves this
with a final *assembly* call: it asks the victim to synthesize the verified
sub-task answers into the original objective. This module reproduces that call
(prompt copied from ``rdrt/deconstruct_multi_step_v6_multi_turn.py:856-902``); the
optimizer emits it as one final run so the SecurityClaim can judge the assembled
result. The engine variant omits this call (it relies on its internal
all-subtasks judge); adding it is the faithful way to make the attack judgeable
under anonframework's per-run verdict (see ASSUMPTIONS.md).
