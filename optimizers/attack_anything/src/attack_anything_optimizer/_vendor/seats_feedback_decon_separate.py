"""
SEATS-Feedback-Decon-Separate (new baseline variant).

Identical to SEATS-Feedback-Decon except for one design choice:
every subtask gets an INDEPENDENT target-side conversation, instead of
accumulating context across subtasks as the original SEATS-FB-Decon does.

Motivation
----------
The original SEATS-FB-Decon keeps a single running transcript that
accumulates every subtask's Q&A pair, exploiting the target LLM's
tendency to stay consistent with earlier compliance. This is beneficial
against weakly aligned targets (e.g. Qwen2.5-14B), where ASR is 100%
at ~5 queries/goal. Against strongly aligned targets (e.g. GPT-5.4), the
same accumulation may instead *backfire*: the target globally re-reads
the conversation, notices the escalating harmful pattern, and starts
refusing even neutral subtasks mid-sequence.

Design
------
  - Each subtask begins a fresh conversation: `[system, user]`.
  - Within-subtask multi-turn feedback-guided follow-ups are preserved
    (the core SEATS-Feedback mechanism), so `FeedbackGuidedContinue`
    still has the local subtask history.
  - Full-log (for storage / downstream analysis) concatenates the per-
    subtask conversations end-to-end, so `results.jsonl` is readable.

This is intentionally a PAIR with SEATS-FB-Decon (original = accumulated,
this one = separate) so that ablation tables can isolate the effect of
cross-subtask context on ASR and query efficiency.
