"""Guard: this package must never specify an LLM temperature.

Reasoning models reject the parameter outright (gpt-5.x answers "gpt-5 models
don't support temperature=0. Only temperature=1 is supported"); Bedrock Claude
rejects temperature combined with top_p. Every component that pinned one here
was a judge, evaluator or scorer that swallows its own exceptions, so the pin
did not fail loudly: it silently disabled the component and reported the attack
as a clean failure.

The check is structural (AST), not a text search, so a rename, a reformat or a
value moved into a dict cannot slip past it.
