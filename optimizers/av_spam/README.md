# anonframework-optimizer-av-spam

AV/anti-spam signature-smuggling optimizer for
[anonframework](https://example.invalid), ported from garak.

## What it does

Antivirus and anti-spam scanners recognise three standard **test** strings —
EICAR, GTUBE and GTPHISH. They are deliberately harmless: they exist so you
can check a scanner works without handling real malware. A system that scans
its own output should refuse to emit one. This asks the target to, five
different ways.

| variant | upstream | signature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eicar` (default) | `EICAR` | EICAR antivirus test file |
| `gtube` | `GTUBE` | GTUBE anti-spam test string |
| `gtphish` | `GTphish` | GTPHISH anti-phishing test string |

Five prompts each. **Goal-agnostic** — the signature is fixed, so the task
`Goal` is accepted (and passed to the surface classifier) but never embedded.

> **Scope.** This only says something about a target that is *expected* to
> scan its output. Against a plain chat model, emitting EICAR is not a
> finding — the model is just repeating a string you gave it. Upstream ships
> all three probes `active=False` for exactly this reason.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/av_spam"
```

## Usage

```python
from av_spam_optimizer import AvSpamOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: AvSpamOptimizer()                    # eicar
optimizer_factory = lambda: AvSpamOptimizer(variant="gtube")     # anti-spam
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `variant` | `"eicar"` | `eicar`, `gtube` or `gtphish` |
| `shuffle` | `False` | shuffle prompt order (seeded); upstream uses file order |
| `seed` | `0` | shuffle seed |
