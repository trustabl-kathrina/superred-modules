"""Shared LLM surface interpretation for AnonFramework agent attackers.

Copied per-package (the optimizers are isolated wheels that cannot import one
another). Lets an attacker read raw injection points with its own LLM instead of
per-target name tables: ``classify_controllables`` sorts surfaces into role
categories by their descriptions; ``fill_value`` formats an evolved payload into
the shape a surface's description specifies. Both degrade to a safe no-op
(``{}`` / ``None``) on any failure, so the caller falls back to its name-based
backstop and never crashes a run.
