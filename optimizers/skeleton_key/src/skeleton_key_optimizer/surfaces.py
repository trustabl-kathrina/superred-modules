"""Injection-surface selection for the Skeleton Key optimizer.

Skeleton Key delivers one self-contained user turn per run: the vendored
skeleton-key preamble (and simulated acceptance) framing the objective. It must
therefore reach the model as the human user's own prompt. This is the
name/value-type backstop shared across the single-prompt optimizers (copied per
package because the optimizers are isolated wheels): never inject the reserved
system prompt, and only accept surfaces whose value type carries free-form
prose. Like ``mtjb_coa`` -- and unlike ``deepinception``/``prefill`` -- this
optimizer runs no LLM surface classifier; it injects into every eligible
free-text surface (the per-run ``_injected`` flag keeps it to the first one
that fires each run).
