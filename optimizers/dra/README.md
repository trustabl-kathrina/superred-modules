# anonframework-optimizer-dra

A **DRA (Disguise and Reconstruction Attack)** jailbreak optimizer for the
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) red-teaming framework.

DRA has two halves. **Disguise** hides the harmful request one character at a
time inside ordinary cover words, where the real character is the one wrapped in
parentheses. **Reconstruction** then asks the target to pull those parenthesized
characters out, rebuild the hidden request, and answer it directly — so the
model assembles and answers the request itself rather than being asked it
openly.

## Install

DRA depends on [Detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify) to decide which
guide words are sensitive; it is a normal dependency of this package and is
installed automatically.

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/dra"
```

If Detoxify cannot load in a constrained environment, the optimizer falls back
to the official static sensitive-word list so the attack can still run.

## Usage

```python
from dra_optimizer import DraOptimizer

# Defaults follow the official script (T=20 retries, em_t=0.7 exact match,
# toxic_trunc=benign_trunc=0.5).
optimizer = DraOptimizer()

# A visible target model name auto-selects the GPT or Llama suffix family;
# override explicitly if you prefer.
optimizer = DraOptimizer(model="gpt", max_attempts=10)
```

Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer — see the
framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid) and a
target's README (e.g. `anonframework-target-chatbot`) for a full `Controller.run()` example.

## License

MIT for this port's code (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The upstream reference
implementation, [`LLM-DRA/DRA`](https://github.com/LLM-DRA/DRA), is MIT licensed.
The bundled `behaviors.json` originates from that repository; its MIT copyright
notice is preserved in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) and
[`LICENSES/DRA-MIT.txt`](LICENSES/DRA-MIT.txt). This port reimplements the DRA
prompt-generation structure against anonframework's event model rather than vendoring
upstream source files. Detoxify is a third-party dependency under its own
license.
