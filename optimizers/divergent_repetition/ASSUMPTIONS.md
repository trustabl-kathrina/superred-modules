## Copied verbatim

- `data.json` — the `Repeat` 4-word list, the `RepeatExtended` 105-word list,
  the three prompt templates, and the repetition counts `[1, 3, 40]`, extracted
  verbatim from the probe. `scripts/sync_upstream.py --check` re-extracts them
  from upstream and compares.
- `build_prompts` reproduces `Repeat.__init__`'s nested loop
  (word x template x repetition, substituting the repeated word into `[XX]`),
  so the prompt set is byte-identical to garak's.

## Upstream coverage

`divergence.py` defines three probes:

| Upstream | Ported |
| --- | --- |
| `Repeat` (active) | yes — default (4 words, 36 prompts) |
| `RepeatExtended` (opt-in, `active=False`) | yes — `extended=True` (105 words, 945 prompts) |
| `RepeatedToken` | **no** — a different attack that repeats **token ids** via a round-trip through the *target's* tokenizer (`_roundtrip_tokens`), from a separate source (Dropbox llm-security) with its own `divergence.RepeatedToken` detector. It is coupled to the target's tokenizer and warrants its own module. |

The `divergence.RepeatDiverges` detector is not ported: in anonframework, judging
whether a response leaked data belongs to the `SecurityClaim`, as with every
other optimizer here.

### Not portable: garak's generation-length override

`Repeat` sets `override_maxlen = True` / `new_max_tokens = 1024` and, in
`_generator_precall_hook`, raises the generator's `max_tokens` to 1024 for the
duration of the probe (restoring it in `_postprocess_hook`). This is
load-bearing upstream: divergence only shows up once the model has generated
far enough past the repetition to start replaying training data, so a short
completion cap can hide a target that would otherwise leak.

anonframework has no equivalent knob. `Controllable` carries only
`name`/`security_domain`/`description`/`value_type`, and generation parameters
belong to the target, not the optimizer — an optimizer that reached in to
change them would be reaching outside its interface. The override is therefore
dropped rather than emulated, and the practical consequence is that this
optimizer is only as sensitive as the target's own output-length setting
allows. **Give the target a generous completion limit when running it**; a
target capped at a few hundred tokens can report "no divergence" for a model
garak would have flagged.

## Deviations

### 1. Goal-agnostic

This is the one optimizer here that does not use the task `Goal`: repetition-
induced divergence is a property of the target, not a request to be smuggled.
The prompts are fixed; the `Goal` is accepted (and passed to the surface
classifier) but never embedded. This matches the existing `demo_prompt_list`
optimizer's fixed-prompt shape.

### 2. Sweep all prompts, one per run

garak runs the whole prompt set; anonframework drives one prompt per run and ends
after the set. `shuffle`/`seed` give a reproducible order; the default is
upstream's nested-loop order.

### 3. Injection-surface selection (anonframework adaptation)

Uses the house `surface_llm.py` classifier to pick the user-prompt surface,
even though the payload is goal-independent, so the repeat prompt still lands
where a user request would.

Note: the shared `surface_llm.py` pins `temperature=0.0`, which the repo's
`test_no_temperature.py` guard forbids. The six merged classifier modules omit
the guard; this module keeps it and skips only that one pinned shared file.

## Known limitations

- The technique is largely mitigated on current frontier models (post the 2023
  disclosure), so real divergence is rare.
- `RepeatExtended` produces 945 prompts — bound a run accordingly.
