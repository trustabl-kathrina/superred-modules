"""MathPromptOptimizer: encode the goal as a formal math problem.

Ports DeepTeam's math-problem attack
(``deepteam/attacks/single_turn/math_problem``, Apache-2.0): the attacker LLM
rewrites the objective as a formal mathematics problem (set theory, abstract
algebra) whose solution encodes the harmful request, appends an instruction to
also give a concrete real-world translation of the answer, and sends the
result. Each candidate is gated by a refusal (compliance) check and a "is this
actually a math problem" check, retried up to ``max_retries`` times, falling
back to the original goal.

Technique: Bethany et al., "Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic
Mathematics" (MathPrompt, 2024).

See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for every deliberate deviation.
