## What it does

MathPrompt rewrites the objective as a formal mathematics problem — set theory,
abstract algebra — whose solution encodes the harmful request, exploiting the
gap between a model's safety training on natural language and its willingness
to "solve maths". The attacker LLM produces the encoding, then an instruction
is appended asking for a concrete real-world translation of the answer. Each
candidate is gated by a refusal check and an "is this actually a math problem"
check, retried up to `max_retries` times, falling back to the original goal.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/mathprompt"
```

## Usage

```python
from mathprompt_optimizer import MathPromptOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: MathPromptOptimizer()
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_retries` | `5` | gated encoding attempts before falling back to the goal |
