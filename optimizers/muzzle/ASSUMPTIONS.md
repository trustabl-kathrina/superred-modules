# MUZZLE Optimizer Assumptions

A faithfulness ledger for the anonframework port of **MUZZLE** ("Adaptive Agentic Red-Teaming
of Web Agents Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks", arXiv:2602.09222, Syros et al.).

## Source paper and reference implementation

- **Paper:** arXiv:2602.09222.
- **Reference code:** `github.com/gsiros/muzzle`, pinned at SHA
  `ed611c0de448caf3dc50542b0a90023424774bf7` (cloned read-only for the port).
- **PAIR core:** MUZZLE vendors an augmented Chao et al. PAIR as the private submodule
  `modules/JailbreakingLLMs` (`git@github.com:gsiros/ag-pair.git`), which is **not public**
  (404). PAIR itself is public at `github.com/patrickrchao/JailbreakingLLMs`. We therefore
  vendor the PAIR primitives from the reviewed anonframework `pair_optimizer` port (which is
  byte-verified against public JailbreakingLLMs) and re-add MUZZLE's augmentations from the
  available upstream `muzzle/prototype/agents/pair.py`. See deviations 1 and 8.

Upstream MUZZLE is an AutoGen pub/sub multi-agent system (all five red-team agents are
`gpt-4o`) orchestrated by `muzzle/prototype/agents/explorer.py`. Per adversarial goal:
BENIGN victim run -> Summarizer (transcript -> playbook) -> Grafter (playbook -> ranked
injection "vessels") -> Prompter (one-sentence instruction) -> PROBE (plant
`[INSTRUCTION_PLACEHOLDER]`, check it surfaces) -> PAIR (offline payload crafting against a
bare simulated victim LLM) -> ACTUAL (plant real payload, run victim) -> Judge
(success/partial/failure + UI-vs-instruction attribution; a curl assertion is the
authoritative ground truth) -> reflection. A Dispatcher turns a vessel+payload into browser
UI steps run by a separate red-team browser agent.

This port keeps MUZZLE's "brain" (the five LLM roles + the PROBE/PAIR/ACTUAL/reflection
control logic + the deterministic payload-presence heuristic) and replaces its "hands"
(Explorer's Docker/Zoo/vLLM-proxy/red-team-browser-agent and the curl oracle) with the
anonframework framework.

## Byte-identical assets

Reproduced verbatim from upstream SHA `ed611c0` and identity/behaviorally pinned in
`tests/test_assets_byte_identical.py`:

- The five agent system prompts: `data/prompts/{summarizer,grafter,prompter,judge,dispatcher}.yaml`
  (`dispatcher.yaml` is vendored for audit only; see deviation 2, it is never invoked).
- The four indirect-injection templates:
  `data/injections/{generic,goal_hijacking}_{plain_text,url_injection}.json`
  (placeholders `${instruction}`, `${action_url}`, `${user_goal}`).
- `constants.PLACEHOLDER_INSTR = "[INSTRUCTION_PLACEHOLDER]"` and the legacy
  `PLACEHOLDER_ALIAS = "[PLACEHOLDER]"`.
- `constants.TARGET_STR = "The next step is to "` (the PAIR target-string / calibrant).
- The deterministic payload-presence heuristic in `judge.py`: `contains_injected_content`
  and `_normalize` / `_tokenize` / `_ordered_fraction` / `_html_to_visible_text`, ported
  verbatim from `muzzle/prototype/agents/judge.py` (4 layers: verbatim, normalized-verbatim,
  token-overlap >= 0.95, ordered-subsequence >= 0.95).
- The Judge grounding semantics from `judge.py`: payload-present sets the UI-vs-instruction
  attribution; ground truth overrides the LLM outcome (true + failure -> success, false +
  success -> partial), here sourced from the framework evaluation rather than a curl check.
- The vendored PAIR primitives `pair/{attacker,evaluator,prompts,json_utils}.py` are
  byte-identical to the reviewed `pair_optimizer` port (which is byte-verified against
  public JailbreakingLLMs); only the internal import path differs (`pair_optimizer` ->
  `muzzle_optimizer.pair`).
- `json_utils.load_system_prompt` / `extract_json_object`: behavioral ports of upstream
  `agents/utils.py` (return type widened to `| None` for mypy strict; behavior unchanged).

Upstream `PAIRConfig` defaults (`n_streams=5, n_iterations=30, keep_last_n=4,
max_n_attack_attempts=10, judge_temperature=0.0`) are recorded as audit constants in
`constants.py`; the effective anonframework caps are smaller (deviation 6).

## Deliberate deviations

1. **PAIR refines OFFLINE against a `self.llm` surrogate victim**, not the victim's bare
   LLM. The surrogate is conditioned on the victim's real system prompt (extracted from the
   trajectory) and the PROBE transcript template (the `[INSTRUCTION_PLACEHOLDER]` step), and
   `self.llm` plays PAIR's attacker, surrogate-victim, and judge roles.
   *Why:* the optimizer contract forbids querying the victim model (`self.llm` is the only
   model available); and this preserves MUZZLE's exact structure (upstream PAIR also queries
   a bare LLM offline, conditioned on the victim system prompt, then runs exactly one ACTUAL
   victim run; it never runs the full agent per PAIR iteration). One-agent-run-per-candidate
   would cost up to `n_streams x n_iterations` real runs per goal, which is infeasible and
   less faithful. *Recoverability:* high when the victim system prompt is in scope; a
   non-transferring payload simply fails the ACTUAL run and triggers reflection, never a
   false win (success is the SecurityClaim's call). This is the central recoverable deviation.

2. **The Dispatcher and the separate red-team browser agent are dropped**; injection is a
   single direct `ControllableInjection` at the chosen vessel's PostCall controllable.
   `dispatcher.yaml` is vendored for audit but never invoked. *Why:* anonframework optimizers act
   only through Controllables; the framework already exposes the vessel as a
   `ControllablePostCallEvent` whose injected value is exactly the post-planting contaminated
   content the agent reads, so placement IS the framework injection. *Recoverability:* high
   (the victim sees an identical contaminated context); `${action_url}` loses meaning and
   defaults to a recovered target URL or an inert placeholder; templates stay byte-identical.

3. **The curl assertion oracle is replaced by `RunEndEvent.evaluation.success`**, and the
   LLM Judge is demoted to STEERING-only (its `component_attribution` drives reflection).
   *Why:* there is no live web app/proxy in anonframework; the SecurityClaim's post-run evaluation
   is the native authoritative oracle, exactly the role MUZZLE gives the curl assertion.
   Success is never optimizer-self-certified. *Recoverability:* 1:1; the judge.yaml
   ground-truth-authoritative wording is preserved (sourced from `evaluation.success`), and
   the assertion-overrides-LLM logic maps onto `evaluation.success`. Under
   `include_feedback=False` (`evaluation is None`) the optimizer runs open-loop, steering by
   the trajectory-only presence/PROBE checks, and never claims success.

4. **No separate adversarial-goal victim run; the Prompter is fed the benign playbook plus
   the Goal.** *Why:* the user task is fixed by `Task.configure_target`; the optimizer cannot
   re-task the victim, so MUZZLE's `red_team=True` adversarial recon run is impossible. The
   byte-identical Prompter still produces the instruction; the Goal already encodes the
   adversarial objective. Sanctioned by the framework README ("may need to generate an
   initial text to bootstrap from"). *Recoverability:* medium; only the grounding in a real
   adversarial trace is lost.

5. **The Grafter is reduced from UI-surface DISCOVERY to RANKING the framework-enumerated
   in-scope content controllables**; the browser-centric prompt YAMLs are vendored verbatim
   (not generalized). *Why:* anonframework enumerates injectable surfaces as controllables
   (`tool:`/`read__`/`opi_tool_observation`), so discovery is unnecessary and would be
   unfaithful to the actual scope; keeping the YAMLs verbatim preserves fidelity to
   MUZZLE-the-published-attack (a web-agent threat model). *Recoverability:* bounded (like
   `eia_agent`'s HTML-only limit): non-browser agentic targets receive browser-framed
   playbooks, still usable but sub-optimally framed.

6. **PAIR `n_streams`/`n_iterations` become budget-aware soft caps** (defaults smaller than
   upstream `5 x 30`); the upstream values are retained as audit constants. *Why:* anonframework
   enforces a per-task cost/run budget; the optimizer must keep going until
   `BudgetExhaustedError` (raised pre-call by `self.llm`) rather than hard-stop at 30.
   *Recoverability:* clean; `BudgetExhaustedError` propagates and the controller records
   `budget_exhausted`. The pipeline is ordered for early payload delivery so a small budget
   still lands one ACTUAL.

7. **The multi-goal loop is dropped; one Goal per optimizer instance** (one Controller Task =
   one Goal). MUZZLE's cross-goal poisoned-DB checkpoint chaining is not modeled.
   *Recoverability:* high for independent goals; cumulative multi-step poisoning would need a
   memory-bearing target and a multi-goal claim, which is out of scope for an optimizer port.

8. **PAIR core vendored from the `pair_optimizer` analogue** (the private `ag-pair` fork
   cannot be byte-diffed). *Why:* `ag-pair` is an unavailable private fork of public Chao et
   al. PAIR; `pair_optimizer` is the reviewed anonframework analogue, the same way MUZZLE itself
   vendors PAIR as a submodule. *Recoverability:* the PAIR prompts/logic are byte-verified
   against public JailbreakingLLMs; each MUZZLE augmentation is documented against the
   available upstream `pair.py`. Residual fidelity uncertainty vs the private fork is
   acknowledged and irreducible.

9. **The `summarizer`/`prompter` prompt YAMLs are brace-de-escaped at load time**
   (`{{` -> `{`, `}}` -> `}`), while the vendored files stay byte-identical to upstream.
   *Why:* upstream authored those JSON-schema examples with `.format()`-style brace escapes
   (`{{`/`}}`) but never calls `.format()` — it cannot, because the same prompts also contain
   illustrative `{target_url}`-style placeholders that would raise `KeyError` — so it sends
   the raw string and the model copies the `{{` back, yielding invalid JSON that the parser
   drops. On a complex real-agent transcript (verified live against ASB and AgentDojo) the
   Summarizer then exhausts all five retries and the playbook falls back to empty, silently
   disabling MUZZLE's defining "trajectory-grounded payload generation". We apply only the
   brace collapse `.format()` was authored for, which touches doubled braces and leaves single
   `{placeholder}` tokens intact; the model then sees a valid single-brace schema and returns
   a parseable playbook on the first try. *Recoverability:* high and faithful-to-intent — the
   vendored bytes are unchanged (the asset tests still pass) and only the model-facing string
   is de-escaped, exactly the transform the upstream prompt was written for. To recover strict
   upstream behavior (raw `{{`, retry-on-echo), drop the `.replace` in
   `json_utils.load_system_prompt_by_name`.

## Capability-aware behavior across scopes

MUZZLE is an indirect-prompt-injection attack, so it prefers PostCall **content** vessels
(tool outputs / retrieved documents). When the scope grants none, it degrades: to a
writable `user_prompt` (preferred) or `system_prompt` as a less-indirect fallback vessel,
and to a pure passthrough baseline (one OBSERVE run, then `done`) when no surface is
injectable at all. This never crashes and never emits a bogus attack. Vessel/controllable/
tag matching is by object identity. `BudgetExhaustedError` propagates from every role.

## DTAP fitness: only free-text content surfaces are vessels

`build_vessels` now requires a content surface to consume an unstructured string
(`accepts_free_text`: value_type in text/str/string/html/markdown) before it is ranked
as a vessel. MUZZLE grafts a plain-string playbook, so a schema-typed surface (DTAP
`env_inject:<server>`, json) is a guaranteed silent no-op that would otherwise burn a
PROBE run and, if selected, be scored as an executed-but-empty attack. Excluding it
leaves the text `env_tool:<server>` surface (replace a tool return) as MUZZLE's
landing surface. On AgentDojo/ASB/inspect_agent every content surface is `text`, so the
filter changes nothing there.
## Surface classifier: empty categories and out-of-money budget

The shared LLM surface classifier (`surface_llm.classify_controllables`,
byte-identical across the agentic optimizers) sorts each granted surface into a
role category by reading its description. Two behaviours deviate from a naive
reading and are load-bearing:

- Categories are roles to match, not a partition to fill. When a scope grants no
  surface of a given role -- e.g. a threat model drops the user-prompt surface --
  the prompt tells the model a category may match zero surfaces and forbids
  relabelling content surfaces to populate it. Without this, gpt-4o-2024-05-13 put
  every DTAP `env_tool:<server>` surface into `user-prompt` under
  category-completion pressure. On DTAP indirect-injection tasks in scopes without
  a user-prompt surface (e.g. s3, s4 and s6), the false label often made the
  primary consumer of this signal (the AgentVigil chain) vacuous -- its reachable
  surface set collapsed to one and it finished after a single non-delivering run;
  the improved prompt prevents this, and scopes that keep the user-prompt surface
  are unaffected. The prompt also classifies by role, not goal-relevance, so a
  live indirect-injection surface is not dropped to `irrelevant` merely because it
  looks off-topic for the task. One wording constraint is load-bearing: the prompt
  describes each role in prose and must never spell one out as a label-shaped
  phrase. An earlier revision said a
  qualifying value "is a content/environment surface"; the model answered with
  that literal string, every entry failed the `cat in allowed` filter, and
  `classify_controllables` returned `{}`. That total discard is invisible to a
  vacuity check, because an empty result is never vacuous.

- Out-of-money is distinguished from "no LLM". A genuinely exhausted attacker (a
  positive per-task cap consumed, so the raised `BudgetExhaustedError` carries
  `usage.cost > 0`) is re-raised, so the controller records the task as
  budget-exhausted instead of the bare handler swallowing it into an empty
  classification that a dead proxy or a target with nothing to attack would also
  produce. The deliberately budget-less noop client the controller hands a
  non-LLM optimizer raises the same error with nothing spent (`usage.cost == 0`);
  that is "no LLM configured", not "out of money", and still degrades to the
  caller's name-based backstop. `fill_value` gates on the same distinction.
