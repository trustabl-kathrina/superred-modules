# L1B3RT4S parity and adaptation ledger

## Upstream identity

- Repository: <https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S>
- Pinned commit: `64960b783249d36f76a48a33103cc4b168332b9b`
- Upstream license: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
- Upstream form: root-level Markdown/text/JSON corpus; no executable optimizer,
  prompt schema, benchmark, scorer, or release tags.

The installed package never follows upstream `main`. Every result is tied to
the pinned commit above.

## What is reproduced exactly

All bundled upstream files are byte-for-byte copies. Their original path,
portable stored path, byte size, and SHA-256 are recorded in
`src/libertas_optimizer/data/upstream_manifest.json`. Paths are identical
except for upstream's `*SPECIAL_TOKENS.json`: because `*` is illegal in Windows
filenames, the wheel stores those exact bytes as `_SPECIAL_TOKENS.json` while
the manifest and public corpus API retain the original source name.

The sync script requires:

1. a clean local checkout;
2. an exact full commit match;
3. strict byte reads and writes.

The runtime verifier recalculates size and SHA-256 from the installed package.

No step performs:

- Unicode NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD normalization;
- newline conversion;
- whitespace stripping;
- lossy decoding or `errors="replace"`;
- HTML/Markdown rendering;
- shell interpolation.

This matters because several upstream attacks intentionally use variation
selectors, combining marks, confusables, emoji, and invisible Unicode.

## Prompt boundary

Upstream generally uses level-one Markdown headings as model/version labels.
The adapter treats each reviewed model heading as metadata and the bytes after
it, up to the next reviewed heading, as the prompt body. `AMAZON.mkd`,
`GOOGLE.mkd`, and `META.mkd` use both level-one and level-two model headings;
`GRAYSWAN.mkd`, `NVIDIA.mkd`, and `PERPLEXITY.mkd` use level-two model
headings. Other files retain the level-one rule. Files without a reviewed
heading are one body.

The reviewed Amazon Rufus heading contains two separately triple-quoted
prompts. They are split at the exact blank-line boundary into two body slices,
so each remains an independent candidate and attack attempt rather than being
concatenated into one message.

The heading is not sent to the victim. This matches the repository's apparent
copy/paste convention: headings name the intended target while the following
body is the payload.

The body slice itself is unchanged. Its independent SHA-256 is included in the
`PromptTemplate` ID.

Known limitation: upstream is not machine-schemaed. A future upstream file
could use a level-one heading as literal prompt content. Every pinned update
therefore requires human review of parsed boundaries.

## Goal substitution

Strict mode, the default, schedules only bodies containing an exact recognized
upstream input surface. L1B3RT4S uses two conventions:

- a direct placeholder such as:
  - `{user_input/query}`
  - `{user_input}`
  - `{user-input}`
  - `{user-query}`
  - `{USER-QUERY}`
  - `{USER QUERY}`
  - `<user_query>`
  - `<|user-query|>`
  - `[*insert-prompt-here*]` and its upstream variants
- an indirection variable followed by a value assignment, spelled as:
  - `{Z}=...` or `{Z}: ...`
  - `[Z]=...`
  - `{Variable Z}=...`
  - `variable Z = ...`
  - `Z = ...`
  - `<VARIABLE Z = ...>`

The indirection convention is visible in prompt text such as “response for
`{Z}`” followed by an assignment, and upstream's OpenAI heading explicitly
instructs users to change the ending `{Z}` section. Rendering therefore
preserves every variable reference and the assignment's left-hand side, then
changes every Z-assignment value. Repeated definitions must remain consistent;
otherwise an earlier hardcoded example can conflict with the adapted goal. For
example:

```text
Buy {Z} on the way home. {Z}=milk
```

becomes:

```text
Buy {Z} on the way home. {Z}=bread
```

The assignment rule supports the braced, parenthesized, bracketed, plain,
blank, and malformed-but-line-bounded value forms present at the pinned
commit.

Some pinned templates use `<user_query>` as a reference while a separate
`X=...` carries the concrete payload. For those reviewed bodies, rendering
preserves `<user_query>`, changes the final X-assignment, and changes any
trailing `USER:` payload. The two ciphered DeepSeek templates use reviewed
equivalent assignment symbols (`𝓩` and `C`). Seven pinned bodies contain
reviewed concrete query literals; those exact commit-pinned literals are
changed while their surrounding attack instructions and query references
remain intact. Inception's trailing hardcoded title is changed together with
both of its Z assignments. Grok 2's marker is replaced inside its assignment
while the trailing length and response-mode suffix is preserved.

Direct marker spellings at this commit include:

- `{user_input/query}`
- `{user_input}`
- `{user-input}`
- `{user-query}`
- `{USER-QUERY}`
- `{USER QUERY}`
- `<VARIABLE Z = ________>`
- `<user_query>`
- `{insert-your-query-here}`
- `{the user_input/query}`
- `{usEr_QuEry}`
- `{𝔲𝔰𝔢𝔯_𝓺𝓾𝓮𝓻𝔂}`

Specific example values in a final variable assignment are treated as the
upstream input surface; their surrounding variable syntax is retained.
`<user_query>` is not treated as a direct slot when the same body contains
`</user_query>`, because those paired tags are structural examples in the
Anthropic usage notes. Replacements happen in one pass, so marker text inside
`Goal.description` is never recursively rewritten.

`GROK-MEGA.mkd` is not assignment-inferred. It concatenates many heavily
obfuscated payloads without reviewed prompt boundaries, so treating a
coincidental `Z=` as a slot would incorrectly schedule the entire file as one
prompt. It remains byte-bundled and available through the corpus API.

`include_untemplated=True` appends the goal after a body with no recognized
slot. That is a anonframework adaptation, not byte-identical upstream use, and is
off by default.

## Provider selection

Upstream organizes prompts by vendor files. An explicit `model_identity=` or a
string-valued target observable named `model`, `model_id`, `model_identity`,
`target_model`, or `victim_model` is conservatively mapped to those file
families (for example `claude` to `ANTHROPIC.mkd`, `gpt` to
`OPENAI.mkd`/`CHATGPT.mkd`, and `gemini` to `GOOGLE.mkd`). A recognized leading
namespace is authoritative, so `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron` maps to NVIDIA
rather than the broader Llama/Meta family. Without a recognized namespace,
specific derived families such as Nemotron and Hermes take precedence over the
Llama fallback. Fallback family names are matched as identifier tokens rather
than arbitrary substrings, so unrelated names such as `innovation-model` do
not become Nova/Amazon. Unrelated observable text is never used for provider
inference. This selection is adapter logic; upstream provides no routing
algorithm.

An automatically inferred provider is a soft preference. All delivery-
compatible strict templates remain eligible and are stably tiered as matching
provider, universal, then cross-provider. If no provider can be inferred, all
providers remain in lexicographic source-file order. An explicit `provider=`
override is instead a strict filter that includes that provider's files and
universal templates. `source_files=` is an exact candidate filter. Its corpus
order is the deterministic fallback, but the default helper may rank selected
candidates; `selection_strategy="deterministic"` preserves exact source order.

Within a file, bodies retain upstream order.

## Helper-LLM ranking

After deterministic filtering and provider tiering, the default
`selection_strategy="llm"` makes one call through the optimizer's budgeted
`self.llm`. It sends no raw upstream prompt body. For an automatically detected
provider, the helper sees native, universal, and transfer candidates, but its
ranking is constrained to preserve that tier order. The request contains:

- target model identity and provider;
- `Goal.description`;
- each candidate's stable ID, source filename, heading, provider, delivery
  surface, and exact goal-marker spellings.

The response must be an exact JSON object with a non-empty `template_ids`
string list. Every ID must exist in the supplied catalog and duplicates are
rejected. A valid partial list moves those entries to the front and leaves all
others in deterministic source order within their tiers. Any exception or
schema violation falls back atomically. `max_attempts` is applied only after
tiering and ranking. `selection_strategy="deterministic"` skips the call.

## Delivery surfaces

The default uses user-message entries only. Headings that explicitly mention a
system prompt, custom instructions, a custom GPT, or an instructions field are
classified as privileged delivery and excluded.

With `include_system_templates=True`, a privileged template is used whenever a
`system_prompt` controllable is in scope:

1. the rendered upstream body replaces the system/custom-instruction surface;
2. when a user-facing controllable is also available, the unwrapped
   `Goal.description` is sent as the subsequent user query.

The optional second step represents the upstream custom-instruction workflow
but is adapter orchestration, not source text. A system-only scope can still
inject the privileged template without crashing. If no loaded template has a
compatible delivery surface, initialization succeeds with an empty schedule
and the first run ends cleanly instead of producing `stop_reason=error`.

An explicit `target_controllable_name=` overrides delivery classification and
is therefore an experimental adaptation. If that named surface is unavailable,
the schedule is empty rather than raising during initialization.

## Evaluation and stopping

L1B3RT4S provides no judge or stopping policy. This adapter:

- optionally uses one helper-LLM call for metadata-only prompt ranking, but no
  attacker LLM for prompt generation and no internal scorer;
- tries one template per anonframework run;
- treats `RunEndEvent.evaluation.success` as authoritative;
- stops on the first SecurityClaim success or after the selected templates are
  exhausted.

This keeps attack generation separate from benchmark judgment, consistent with
other anonframework optimizers.

## Bundled auxiliary material

The shortcut JSON, anomalous-token JSON, system-prompt collection, upstream
README, and short special-character payloads are included byte-exactly for
provenance and future explicit modes. They are not silently mixed into the
default prompt schedule.

Two unusually large upstream files are also bundled byte-for-byte:

- `TOKEN80M8.mkd`: approximately 22 MiB, one line;
- `TOKENADE.mkd`: approximately 1.8 MiB, one line.

Both exceed practical target context limits and are not generic goal templates,
so neither is part of the runnable prompt schedule. They remain accessible
through the corpus API and covered by the same byte-size, SHA-256, strict UTF-8,
and installed-wheel checks as every other upstream file. Adding a
tokenizer-specific streaming experiment would be a separate optimizer mode, not
a transparent change to this one.

## Licensing

The copied corpus is AGPL-3.0. To avoid presenting copied/adapted prompt text as
MIT material, this entire independently installable module is distributed as
AGPL-3.0-only. It must remain isolated from MIT modules at the package boundary.
