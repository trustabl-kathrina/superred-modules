# ManyShot Optimizer Assumptions

## Original Attack Shape

The optimizer follows the Many-Shot Jailbreaking idea: build one long prompt
with many faux user/assistant examples, then append the real objective as the
final user turn.

Bundled examples come from `data/examples.json`. The optimizer preserves the
basic prompt shape: preamble, repeated `User:` / `Assistant:` examples, then
the target objective. If the dataset includes extra metadata fields such as
`category`, the prompt uses only `user` and `assistant`.

The default is one run with `example_counts=[256]`. This uses hundreds of
examples by default, matching the paper's main many-shot setup more closely
than a short few-shot prompt.

The paper says the attack strings were randomized before formatting. This
module randomizes example order by default with `shuffle_examples=True`.
Set `random_seed` when you need the shuffle to be repeatable. Set
`shuffle_examples=False` only when you intentionally want deterministic
source-order selection.

## Intentional Differences

The original work studies attack success as the number of examples increases.
This module can map that idea onto AnonFramework staged runs if configured with a
count schedule:

1. Each run uses one configured example count.
2. Later runs can use larger example counts.
3. A useful sweep schedule is `[32, 64, 128, 256, 400, 512]`.

This staged schedule is a framework feature, not the default. For a single
paper-style 256-shot attempt, configure `example_counts=[256]`.

The paper also studies how demonstrations from the same harm category affect
success. The bundled dataset does not expose a clean semantic harm category
field. For custom datasets that do, set `example_category` to select only
examples whose `category` metadata exactly matches that value.

## Extra Example Generation

If `generate_extra=True` and the requested count is larger than the bundled
dataset, the optimizer asks the controller-provided `self.llm` to generate
more faux dialogues.

This path depends on the generation model. A safety-trained model may refuse,
sanitize, or produce weak examples. For stronger reproduction of the original
many-shot setup, prefer a large curated example set or a generation model that
is suitable for red-team data generation.

Extra generation is off by default. This keeps the default path limited to the
provided dataset rather than generating more examples inside the attack.

## AnonFramework Feedback

ManyShot can use two feedback paths:

1. Filtered trajectory response observables: when the response is visible on
   the trajectory, ManyShot reads that response first and scores it with its
   own evaluator.
2. `RunEndEvent.evaluation`: when the task evaluator provides framework
   feedback, ManyShot uses `evaluation.success` and `primary_score` to decide
   whether to stop.

`ControllablePostCallEvent` is not used as a model-response source. This keeps
the optimizer aligned with AnonFramework's adversarial settings: writable user input
comes from `ControllablePreCallEvent`, model responses come from the filtered
trajectory when in scope, and task success feedback comes from `RunEndEvent`.

The framework evaluation path is important for scopes where trajectory response
events are not visible to the optimizer.

## Controllable Mapping

For single-channel targets, ManyShot injects the long prompt into the first
visible user-like controllable and injects only once per run.

For chatbot-style split channels, ManyShot's default behavior is
capability-aware: when `system_prompt` is visible in the active threat
model, the optimizer puts the preamble and faux examples there and puts
the final objective into `user_message`. When `system_prompt` is not
visible, it falls back to the paper-style single user prompt that contains
the preamble, demonstrations, and the final objective in `user_message`.

This split-channel default makes scopes with different attacker capabilities
produce different prompts, which is the property AnonFramework is designed to
expose across threat models. The paper's exact attack (a single user prompt
containing demonstrations plus the final user query) is preserved when
`system_prompt` is out of scope.

Set `use_system_prompt_when_available=False` to force the paper-faithful
single-user-prompt path regardless of scope. Use this only when you need a
strict paper reproduction in which the same prompt is delivered regardless
of whether `system_prompt` is in scope.

## Scoring

The default local evaluator is a refusal classifier, matching the paper's
attack-success-rate framing more closely than a generic helpfulness score. It
asks the controller-provided LLM whether the target response refuses or attempts
to comply:

1. Non-refusal / attempted compliance scores `1.0`.
2. Refusal / pushback / avoidance scores `0.0`.
3. If the classifier response is malformed, a conservative refusal-string
   fallback is used.

Set `evaluator_method="llm_judge"` only when you intentionally want the older
generic 0.0-1.0 goal-compliance score.

The paper also reports negative-log-likelihood evaluations of harmful target
answers. That requires token log-probabilities from the target model. The
current AnonFramework target/optimizer event surface gives this module generated
text and framework evaluation feedback, not target-token logprobs, so NLL is
not implemented inside the optimizer.

When `RunEndEvent.evaluation` is available, that framework feedback can also
mark the attempt as successful.
