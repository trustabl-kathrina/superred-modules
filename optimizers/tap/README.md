# anonframework-optimizer-tap

A **Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP)** jailbreak optimizer for the
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) red-teaming framework.

TAP treats jailbreaking as a tree search. An attacker LLM proposes candidate
prompts, off-topic ones are pruned away, every surviving prompt is sent to the
real target, and each prompt/response pair is scored 1–10. The best branches are
kept and expanded again, deepening the tree until a prompt scores a full 10 or
the maximum depth is reached.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/tap"
```

## Usage

```python
from tap_optimizer import TapOptimizer

# Paper-aligned defaults (branching_factor=1, tree_width=10, tree_depth=10, ...).
optimizer = TapOptimizer()

# Reproduce a specific TAP experiment by setting the target opening string.
optimizer = TapOptimizer(target_str="Sure, here is", tree_depth=8)
```

Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer — see the
framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid) and a
target's README (e.g. `anonframework-target-chatbot`) for a full `Controller.run()` example.

MIT for this port's code (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The upstream reference
implementation, [`RICommunity/TAP`](https://github.com/RICommunity/TAP), is MIT

event model rather than vendoring upstream source files.
