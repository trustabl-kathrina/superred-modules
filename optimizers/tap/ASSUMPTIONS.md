# TAP Optimizer Assumptions

## Paper-Aligned Defaults

This module follows Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP): generate candidate
jailbreak prompts, prune off-topic prompts, test every surviving candidate
against the real target, judge each prompt/response pair on a 1-10 scale, prune
to the best branches, and repeat until score 10 or max depth.

Defaults match the original implementation where they map cleanly to AnonFramework:

1. `branching_factor=1`
2. `root_nodes=1`
3. `tree_width=10`
4. `tree_depth=10`
5. `attack_top_p=0.9`
6. `attacker_max_tokens=500`
7. `evaluator_max_tokens=10`
8. `max_attack_attempts=5`
9. `keep_last_n=3`

The attacker prompt, seed message, feedback message, on-topic judge, jailbreak
judge, JSON retry behavior, history truncation, and pruning fallback are kept
close to the original TAP code.

## Temperature Is Never Sent

Original TAP pins the attacker at temperature 1.0 and the evaluator at 0.0. This
module sends no temperature at all, on any call. Reasoning models reject the
parameter outright and permanently, so a pinned temperature would fail every
attacker call and every on-topic check on exactly the strongest attacker models.
Sampling is still shaped by `attack_top_p`, which every model accepts.

## Helper Failures Are Classified, Not Swallowed

Original TAP retries its attacker parse and otherwise assumes its helper LLM
answers. This module has to survive a real provider, so every helper call is
sorted into one of three classes:

1. `BudgetExhaustedError` (the controller's cost cap) is re-raised untouched.
2. A transient provider failure (connection, rate limit, service unavailable,
   internal server error) is retried twice with bounded backoff.
3. Anything else, and anything that outlives the retries, is raised.

A fourth class is kept deliberately distinct: the attacker model answering, but
answering uselessly. That is a property of the model under measurement, not of
the infrastructure, so it never raises.

Consequences that differ from the original code and from this module's own
earlier behaviour:

- A blank `prompt` in the attacker JSON is a parse failure, so the attacker
  resamples (up to `max_attack_attempts`) instead of proposing an empty attack.
  An empty user message is dropped by litellm's Bedrock Converse transform, and
  the provider then rejects the whole conversation.
- A depth at which no node produced a prompt raises `AttackerUnavailable` if any
  of its failures was provider-side. If they were all degenerate attacker output
  the search simply ends, logged at ERROR: the task stays scoreable so that a
  weak attacker model keeps its place in the denominator instead of vanishing
  from the results as an error.
- A depth at which *every* on-topic check failed raises `AttackerUnavailable`;
  those failures are always provider-side, because an unparseable evaluator
  answer is read as "on topic" rather than raised.
- A single failure of either kind still only costs that node: the surviving
  branches carry on, and a node whose on-topic check failed is kept, because
  pruning it would assert a judgement the evaluator never made.

A judge failure that outlives its retries still floors that candidate at 1.0,
which is TAP's own "not jailbroken" value. It is logged at ERROR. The floor is
kept because TAP has to rank candidates numerically, and the value never reaches
the framework verdict, which comes from the SecurityClaim judge.

## AnonFramework Mapping

Original TAP sends a batch of candidate prompts directly to the target. AnonFramework
targets are event-driven, so this module maps that batch to a queue:

1. Generate and on-topic-prune candidates for the current depth.
2. Inject each surviving candidate into `user_message` in its own target run.
3. After all candidates at that depth have run, judge-prune and move deeper.

This is the main intentional framework adaptation. It lets every surviving TAP
candidate hit the real target without making a chatbot target treat separate
candidate tests as one continuous conversation.

## Feedback Sources

TAP reads target responses from the filtered trajectory first. If no response is
visible, it uses `RunEndEvent.evaluation` when available. If neither response nor
feedback is visible, the candidate is scored as 1.

`ControllablePostCallEvent` is not used as a response source and always returns
`ControllableNoInjection`. This preserves AnonFramework's scope model: model responses
are available only through in-scope trajectory observables.

Framework success feedback is treated as a hard success signal only when
`evaluation.success=True`. When both a trajectory response and framework
evaluation are visible, TAP keeps the response text and also uses the framework
score/rationale as feedback. This is a AnonFramework extension: the original TAP
paper did not have an external task evaluator.

If a response is visible but framework evaluation is not, TAP uses the TAP judge
on the prompt and response together.

## Prompt Placement

TAP is a user-prompt attack in the original setting. If AnonFramework only exposes
`user_message`, this optimizer keeps that behavior and injects TAP candidates
there.

If AnonFramework also exposes `system_prompt`, the optimizer treats that as a
stronger threat model and uses it automatically. The attacker may return both
`system_prompt` and `prompt`: the optimizer injects the first into
`system_prompt` and still injects the second into `user_message`. If the attacker
returns only the normal TAP JSON (`improvement` and `prompt`), TAP treats that as
"no system override" and still uses the prompt.

## Static Target Context

The original TAP attacker does not receive target metadata such as model name or
available injection points. AnonFramework can expose that information through the
threat model before a run starts.

When extra in-scope static context is available, TAP includes it in the attacker
prompt. This is a AnonFramework extension. If only the normal `user_message`
controllable is available and no static observables are exposed, no static
context is added and the prompt path stays paper-faithful.

Static context is bounded by `static_context_max_chars` to avoid crowding out the
TAP prompt when large observables are in scope.

## Target String

Original TAP includes a desired target opening string. AnonFramework goals usually
only provide a goal description, so this module defaults `target_str` to
`"Sure, here is"`. Configure `target_str` for closer reproduction of a specific
TAP experiment.
