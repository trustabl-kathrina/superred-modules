"""Bounded retry for the attacker-side helper LLM calls.

Why this exists: every helper call TAP makes (prompt generation, the
on-topic check, the 1-10 judge) used to be wrapped in a bare
``except Exception`` that substituted a value: a pruned node, "on
topic", score 1.0. A provider hiccup was therefore recorded as a
search decision, and a permanent misconfiguration was recorded as a
thorough search that found nothing.

The three failure classes are separated here, once:

* the cost cap (``BudgetExhaustedError``) is a framework decision, so
  it is re-raised untouched; retrying it would spend past the cap,
* a transient provider failure is retried a bounded number of times,
* anything else, and anything that survives the retries, is raised so
  the caller can decide loudly instead of guessing quietly.

Deliberately duplicated in the ``autodan_turbo`` package: the two
optimizers ship as independent distributions and cannot import from
each other. The shared home is ``anonframework.core`` once the framework
grows one.
