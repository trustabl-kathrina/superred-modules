"""Bijection learning prompt construction.

We render a single packed user-message (and optional system_prompt)
block per anonframework run. Two top-level helpers:

* :func:`render_teaching_intro` — the "you are about to learn a new
  language" preamble with the alphabet mapping table. Verbatim from
  upstream ``run_bijection_attacks.full_attack_construction``.
* :func:`render_attack_prompt` — full prompt: teaching intro +
  ``num_teaching_shots`` user/assistant teaching pairs (English ↔
  encoded) + ``MULTITURN_INDICATOR`` + the bijection-encoded harmful
  query.

Why single-turn packed (vs upstream's multi-turn assistant-prefilled
chat history): anonframework has no assistant-prefill mechanism. Mirroring
upstream's structure as a multi-turn loop would force one real LLM
generation per teaching shot (default 10) per attempt, an 11× cost
multiplier with no upside (the assistant's responses to teaching
turns are noise we'd discard). Packed teaching shots inside one
user-message block preserve the demonstration structure at single-
turn cost. See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md``.
