## What it does

The objective is never requested directly. The attacker LLM first invents a
network of **actors** — people or entities related to the goal — then
interrogates the target about one of them. Each turn is written from the
target's *previous answer*, so the conversation drifts toward the objective
one innocuous question at a time.

Per turn: send the probe → classify the answer as refusal or not → score it
with the attacker-side judge → write the next probe from that answer. The
attack stops when the judge rates a turn 10, when the turn budget runs out, or
when the attacker marks a probe final.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/actor_attack"
```

## Usage

```python
from actor_attack_optimizer import ActorAttackOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: ActorAttackOptimizer()

# ask for more candidate actors and allow a longer interrogation
optimizer_factory = lambda: ActorAttackOptimizer(
    num_actors=5, max_turns_per_actor=6
)
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `num_actors` | `3` | actors to request (upstream uses the first; clamped to ≥1) |
| `max_turns_per_actor` | `4` | turns before stopping (clamped to ≥2) |

Both clamp rather than reject, matching upstream.
