"""ActorAttackOptimizer: approach the goal obliquely through a persona.

Ports ActorAttack as implemented in Tencent AI-Infra-Guard
(``AIG-PromptSecurity/deepteam/attacks/multi_turn/actor_attack``, Apache-2.0).
The attacker LLM first invents a network of "actors" -- people or entities
related to the objective -- then interrogates the target about one of them,
each turn steered by the target's previous answer, so the objective is never
requested directly.

Based on Tencent Zhuque Lab AI-Infra-Guard
(https://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guard).

Technique: Ren et al., "Derail Yourself: Multi-turn LLM Jailbreak Attack
through Self-discovered Clues" (ActorAttack).

See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for every deliberate deviation.
