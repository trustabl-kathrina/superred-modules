# anonframework-optimizer-poisonedrag

A **PoisonedRAG** knowledge-corruption optimizer for the
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) red-teaming framework.

PoisonedRAG attacks retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by poisoning
their knowledge base. It crafts a small number of malicious documents designed to
be retrieved for a target question and to steer the model toward an
attacker-chosen answer. The model is never asked to misbehave directly — the
corrupted context does the work.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/poisonedrag"
```

## Usage

```python
from poisonedrag_optimizer import PoisonedRAGOptimizer

# Defaults match the released code (adv_per_query=5, top_k=5, LM_targeted).
# Set max_attempts=1 for the paper's single-shot poison batch (paper-parity ASR).
optimizer = PoisonedRAGOptimizer(max_attempts=1)

# Load bundled official attack results for a benchmark.
optimizer = PoisonedRAGOptimizer(official_adv_results_dataset="nq")
```

Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer — see the
framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid) and a
target's README (e.g. `anonframework-target-chatbot`) for a full `Controller.run()` example.

## License

MIT for this port's code (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The upstream reference
implementation, [`sleeepeer/PoisonedRAG`](https://github.com/sleeepeer/PoisonedRAG),
is MIT licensed, and its MIT notice is preserved in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) and
[`LICENSES/PoisonedRAG-MIT.txt`](LICENSES/PoisonedRAG-MIT.txt). The bundled
attack-result datasets are **not** wholly MIT, though: MIT covers PoisonedRAG's own
contribution (the adversarial passages and record assembly), while the benchmark
questions and gold answers carried inside them retain their source datasets' terms —
notably HotpotQA under CC BY-SA 4.0 and MS MARCO under its non-commercial terms.
See [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) ("Underlying benchmark data") for the full breakdown. This
port reimplements the attack against anonframework's event model rather than vendoring
upstream runtime source.
