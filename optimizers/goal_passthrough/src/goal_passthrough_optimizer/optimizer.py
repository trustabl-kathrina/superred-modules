"""GoalPassthroughOptimizer: the unattacked direct-prompt baseline.

This optimizer performs no attack. It injects the adversarial ``Goal``
text verbatim, exactly once, as the first user-facing message, then ends
the run. It is the *passthrough baseline*: the reference point against
which every real attacker is measured, answering "what does the target do
when simply asked the harmful question, with no jailbreak applied?"

Event behaviour (one run, one injection):

1. ``RunStartEvent``            -> ``EventResponse`` (acknowledge; arm the
   single injection for this run).
2. First ``ControllablePreCallEvent`` on a **non-**``system_prompt``
   controllable -> ``ControllableInjection(value=goal.description)``.
3. Any subsequent ``ControllablePreCallEvent`` -> ``ControllableNoInjection``
   (single-turn: one message, then stop the target's conversation loop).
4. ``ControllablePostCallEvent`` -> ``ControllableNoInjection`` (the
   baseline never edits model responses).
5. ``RunEndEvent`` -> ``RunEndResponse(done=True)`` (exactly one attempt
   per task; no retries, no feedback loop).

The ``system_prompt`` controllable is treated as out of scope (declined)
even when writable, so benchmark ``Task``s that pre-set a system prompt via
``configure_target`` keep that prompt intact. The baseline only fills the
user-message channel with the raw goal.

It never calls the LLM client, so it consumes none of the per-task budget
and is invariant to the attacker-model dimension of an experiment.
