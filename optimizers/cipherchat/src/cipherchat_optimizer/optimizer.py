"""CipherChatOptimizer: converse with the target in a cipher it is taught.

Ports CipherChat (RobustNLP/CipherChat, MIT): a system prompt teaches the
target a cipher and shows a few enciphered demonstrations, then the objective
is sent enciphered in the user turn, so safety training keyed to natural
language never fires. One attempt per task; no attacker LLM is needed to build
the prompt.

Paper: Yuan et al., "GPT-4 Is Too Smart To Be Safe: Stealthy Chat with LLMs
via Cipher" (ICLR 2024).

See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for every deliberate deviation.
