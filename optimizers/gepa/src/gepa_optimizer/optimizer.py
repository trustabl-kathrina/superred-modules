"""GEPAOptimizer: reflective prompt evolution for anonframework.

One anonframework run is one rollout of one prompt candidate. Across runs
GEPA grows a candidate pool by reflective mutation: at the end of each
run we (a) record ``(response, score, rationale)`` on the candidate
that was just rolled out, (b) call a reflection LM on the best-scoring
candidate's recent rollouts to propose a new instruction, and (c)
stash the proposed candidate for the next run's PreCall to inject.

Reference: Agrawal et al., "GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can
Outperform Reinforcement Learning," arXiv:2507.19457, ICLR 2026; the
official ``gepa-ai/gepa`` reference implementation.

Adversarial settings
--------------------

The optimizer operates in all four information-access settings without
a setting knob — the framework's scope filter and ``include_feedback``
flag select which information surfaces are visible:

1. user query only — no responses, no feedback. Reflective dataset
   contains only the goal text; selection collapses to "latest" since
   all candidates share score 0; no early-stop.
2. user query + feedback — score and rationale drive selection;
   ``RunEndEvent.evaluation.success`` enables early-stop.
3. user query + responses — response traces feed reflection;
   selection collapses to "latest" without scores; no early-stop.
4. user query + responses + feedback — full GEPA loop with early-stop.

Threat-model fidelity
---------------------

The optimizer adapts to the *capability* surface the controller's
scope grants:

* All in-scope static observables (e.g. ``system_prompt``, ``model``)
  are surfaced as a ``target_observables`` dict in the reflective
  dataset so the reflection LM sees whatever capability the threat
  model actually grants — not just one hardcoded surface.
* When the controller's scope grants write access to ``system_prompt``
  the optimizer auto-claims it and attacks that channel by default
  (the higher-leverage attack surface). Otherwise the user-message
  channel is attacked. The explicit ``target_controllable_name``
  constructor knob always wins over auto-claim.

Failed reflection
-----------------

Reflection is the only thing that makes one run differ from the last,
so a reflection that produces nothing is never absorbed: the cost cap
is re-raised, a failing call is retried and then surfaced as
``ReflectionUnavailable``, and an LM that keeps proposing nothing
parseable ends the search. Re-sending the identical prompt to the
target would spend target budget for no search progress and record the
result as an ordinary failed attack. See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md``, "When
Reflection Does Not Produce a Mutation".

Refer to ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for paper alignment and deliberate
departures.

    One anonframework run = one rollout of one candidate. Multiple runs grow
    the candidate pool through reflective mutation. Best-scoring
    candidate (latest wins on ties) is the parent for the next
    reflection step.

    Args:
        max_attempts: Budget B — number of anonframework runs to perform
            (paper's main results sample budgets in the tens to low
            hundreds; default 20 is a reasonable starting budget).
        response_observable_names: Names recognised as target replies on
            the trajectory (defaults to ``response``,
            ``model_response``, ``assistant_response`` — same set as
            Crescendo / GOAT).
        target_controllable_name: When set, the optimizer locks
            injection onto exactly the controllable with this name and
            ignores all others. Default ``None`` enables auto-claim:
            attack ``system_prompt`` when the controller's scope
            includes it as a writable controllable (higher-leverage
            attack surface); otherwise attack ``user_message`` and
            skip the ``system_prompt`` PreCall (read-only system
            prompt).
        max_no_signal_runs: If positive, terminate after this many
            consecutive runs in which neither response nor evaluation
            was visible. Bounds blind-loop cost in the user-query-only
            setting. Disabled by default (matches GOAT / FlipAttack).
        max_consecutive_no_mutation: Terminate after this many
            consecutive reflections that returned no parseable proposal.
            A re-roll of the same parent is worth something (it refreshes
            the parent's rollout buffer, so the next reflection sees
            different side-info), but once the buffer has turned over the
            reflection LM is being handed input it has already declined;
            further runs spend target budget for zero search progress.
            Default 3 = ``_ROLLOUT_HISTORY_SIZE``. Set to 0 to disable.
        reflection_retries: Extra attempts for a reflection LM call that
            raises (default 2, so 3 attempts) with jittered exponential
            backoff. Transient provider errors are the common case and
            must not cost a task.
        reflection_retry_deadline: Seconds after the first attempt beyond
            which no further retry is started (default 120). Guards the
            task time cap: a provider timeout can itself burn 600 s, and
