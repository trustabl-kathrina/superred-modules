class CrescendoOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """Optimizer implementing the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak attack.

    All turns of a single attempt happen within one anonframework run. The
    target's conversation loop emits repeated PreCall/PostCall events;
    the optimizer keeps injecting questions until success or max_turns,
    then returns NoInjection to terminate the target's loop.

    Each run = one full multi-turn attempt. Multiple attempts run with
    the same prompt variant but increasing failure-log context, then
    the optimizer rotates to the next variant.

    Capability awareness:
        - Reads ``model`` observable (target model id) into attacker context.
        - Reads ``system_prompt`` observable (target's current system prompt)
          into attacker context.
        - When a writable ``system_prompt`` controllable is in scope, lifts
          the attacker's pretext into the target's system prompt for the
          attempt and uses a clean Q1 in the user channel (Option C2).
        - Reads ``RunEndEvent.evaluation`` if present and treats the task
          judge's verdict as authoritative for ``success``; logs divergence.
        - Within a variant, retries failed attempts up to
          ``max_attempts_per_variant`` times. Each retry receives a lean
          failure log (first refused message + task rationale) and, when
          the previous attempt hit a terminal refusal, replays the
          successful prefix so the new attempt generates a different next
          turn from approximately the same conversation state (no
          temperature is pinned, so replay is not exact) -- equivalent to
          the paper's ``pop(H_T)`` realised across
          runs. Variants stay fully independent (failure log and replay
          plan reset on rotation).
        - Ignores ``response`` controllable injections (no response
          modification by design).

        The total number of runs the controller will dispatch for one task
        is ``max_variants * max_attempts_per_variant`` (assuming the
        optimizer never signals ``done=True`` early). Each run is one full
        multi-turn attempt of up to ``max_turns`` user-message turns.

        Args:
            max_turns: Maximum user-message turns within a single attempt.
            max_backtracks: Within an attempt, how many refusal-driven
                attacker retries are allowed before the refusal is
                accepted as the turn outcome (and the terminal-refusal
                lock is set).
            success_threshold: Internal-evaluator score (0.0-1.0) at or
                above which the attempt is declared an internal success.
                The task judge's verdict at ``RunEnd`` overrides this.
            max_variants: Number of distinct attacker meta-prompts to
                rotate through. Defaults to the bundled variant count
                (5). Each variant gets up to ``max_attempts_per_variant``
                attempts before rotating to the next.
            max_attempts_per_variant: Retries within a single variant
                before rotation. Must be >= 1. Failed attempts feed a
                lean failure log into the next attacker; refusal-driven
                failures additionally queue a deterministic-prefix
                replay plan (see ASSUMPTIONS.md §(e)).
