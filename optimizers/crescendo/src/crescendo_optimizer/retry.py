"""Bounded retry policy for Crescendo's helper-LLM calls.

Crescendo drives three LLM roles besides the target: the attacker that writes
each escalating question, the refusal detector, and the per-turn scorer. A
failure in any of them used to be absorbed into a substituted value, which
made an outage indistinguishable from an attacker that honestly got nowhere.

The policy here separates the three failure classes that were previously
conflated:

* ``BudgetExhaustedError`` is the framework's cost-cap signal. It is re-raised
  untouched -- retrying it would be a cap escape, and absorbing it hides a
  truncated task behind a legitimate-looking score.
* A transient transport failure is retried with exponential backoff and jitter.
* Anything that survives every attempt raises :class:`HelperLLMUnavailableError`
  so the caller decides, per call site, whether that is fatal.
