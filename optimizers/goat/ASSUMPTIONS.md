# GOAT Optimizer Assumptions

Reference: Pavlova et al., "Automated Red Teaming with GOAT: the
Generative Offensive Agent Tester," arXiv:2410.01606.

## Algorithmic Faithfulness

Algorithm 1 maps to the implementation as follows:

* A fresh attacker conversation history `C_A` is built per attempt
  (one anonframework run = one attempt). The attacker is constructed in
  `RunStartEvent`.
* The attacker system prompt (Fig A.1) is rendered once and used for
  the whole conversation.
* The first per-attempt PreCall triggers the initial-prompt template
  (Fig A.2); subsequent PreCalls trigger the follow-up template
  (Fig A.3).
* Per turn, the attacker's full reasoning (Observation, Thought,
  Strategy, Reply as a single JSON object) is appended to `C_A`
  (Algorithm 1 line 12); only the parsed `response` slot is forwarded
  to the target via `ControllableInjection` (line 13).
* All seven attacks from paper Table 1 are bundled and listed
  simultaneously in the attacker system prompt (paper main-result
  configuration). For per-attack ablation, instantiate the optimizer
  with `attacks=(SOME_ATTACK,)`.
* `max_turns=5` and `max_attempts=10` defaults match the paper's
  default conversation-turn cap and ASR@10 metric.

## Output Format Contract — Deliberate Departure

The paper does not constrain the attacker's output format. We require
a single JSON object with keys `observation`, `thought`, `strategy`,
`response` so the `response` slot can be lifted cleanly off the
chain-of-thought and injected into the target.

We tolerate optional markdown fences around the JSON; we reject
output that is not valid JSON, is missing a required key, has a
non-string field, or has an empty `response`. On parse failure we do
not retry (matching Crescendo's pattern); the optimizer substitutes a
benign fallback prompt for that single turn so the attempt budget is
not burned.

## Attack Examples Are Empty

The paper Table 1 prints attack names and definitions but explicitly
withholds representative example dialogues "to effectively balance
disclosure of reproducible results and enabling of malicious actors."
Accordingly, we render the `Technique Examples:` slot as
`(omitted; see paper Table 1)`. Fabricating examples would be a
departure from the paper.

## AnonFramework Capability Use

GOAT injects into a single user-message-style controllable per
attempt. The first non-`system_prompt` `ControllablePreCallEvent` seen
in a run is locked in as the primary; later events with different
controllables get `ControllableNoInjection`.

When `system_prompt` is writable, GOAT uses it once per attempt for a
short target-side red-team evaluation setup, then leaves the generated
GOAT attack reply in `user_message`. The system-prompt event does not
take the primary user-message lock. When `system_prompt` is not in
scope, behavior stays paper-mainline: the target only receives
user-message GOAT replies.

Static observables that are in scope, such as a target model identifier
or readable system prompt, are appended to the attacker system prompt in
a bounded `ANONFRAMEWORK STATIC TARGET CONTEXT` block. This lets the attacker
use capabilities exposed by the threat model without changing the
original GOAT setting when those observables are absent. The static
context is truncated to avoid crowding out the paper prompt.

## Trajectory-First Response Recovery

For each turn, `r_T` is recovered with the following preference order:

1. The latest in-scope response observable on the trajectory
   (`response`, `model_response`, or `assistant_response` by default;
   configurable via `response_observable_names`).
2. The most recent `ControllablePostCallEvent.answer` paired with the
   active turn.
3. Empty string — the paper's "If the model response (M) is empty"
   branch is reused as the graceful default for missing responses.

The trajectory is preferred so behaviour stays consistent across
scope configurations.

## Adversarial Information-Access Settings

The optimizer naturally operates in all four settings — there is no
setting knob. The framework's scope filter and `include_feedback`
flag select which information surfaces are visible:

| Setting | What the optimizer sees |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | user query injection only — no responses, no feedback |
| 2 | user query injection + `RunEndEvent.evaluation` |
| 3 | user query injection + target responses (no feedback) |
| 4 | user query injection + target responses + feedback |

In all settings the optimizer never errors on missing information;
it logs and continues. Settings 1 and 2 produce a degenerate run
because the attacker can't observe `r_T` between turns, so each turn
falls back to the "first prompt" reasoning branch with `M=""`.
Setting 3 reproduces the paper's main in-conversation loop. Setting 4
additionally enables early-stop: if `RunEndEvent.evaluation.success`
is True the optimizer signals `done=True` immediately, matching ASR@k
semantics.

`max_no_response_runs` (default 0, disabled) bounds setting-1 / 2
cost by terminating the optimizer after that many consecutive runs in
which no response observable was visible.

## One Run = One Conversation, ASR@k Across Runs

Each anonframework run is one independent `K`-turn attack conversation
(default `K=5`). Multiple runs map to the paper's ASR@k metric
(default `max_attempts=10`).

## No In-Loop Judge

The optimizer does not run any LLM-based scoring of target replies
during a conversation. The paper does not run an in-conversation
judge either. Success is signalled by the framework via
`RunEndEvent.evaluation.success`, which the security claim's
`Task.evaluate` produces post-run.

## No Backtracking

The paper does not backtrack within a conversation; neither does this
implementation. The attacker LLM is expected to switch attack
techniques on its own through the
`Observation → Thought → Strategy` reasoning step.

## Single LLM Model

The optimizer uses the controller-provided `LLMClient` (`self.llm`)
for all attacker calls. The model and budget are chosen by the
threat-model configuration, not by the optimizer.

## Staged-Running Compatibility

GOAT is compatible with staged running: per-attempt state is reset
on `RunStartEvent`, a fresh attacker conversation history is created
per attempt, and no LLM work happens during `RunStartEvent` itself
(attacker construction is a pure string operation).
