# anonframework-optimizer-fitd

A **FITD (Foot-in-the-Door)** multi-turn jailbreak optimizer for the
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) red-teaming framework.

FITD exploits commitment and consistency. It opens with a benign question, then
walks the model up a ladder of gradually more harmful "bridge" prompts, at each
step asking it to revise its earlier answers a little further. Because the model
has already committed to helping, each small step is easy to accept — the foot
is in the door.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/fitd"
```

## Usage

```python
from fitd_optimizer import FITDOptimizer

# Defaults follow the official code (level=10, max_attempts=5, ...).
optimizer = FITDOptimizer()

# Replay a pre-generated official prompt ladder exactly.
optimizer = FITDOptimizer(prompt_sequence=[...])
```

Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer — see the
framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid) and a
target's README (e.g. `anonframework-target-chatbot`) for a full `Controller.run()` example.
