# anonframework-optimizer-flip-attack

A **FlipAttack** single-turn jailbreak optimizer for the
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) red-teaming framework.

> **Community port — not an official implementation.** This module is an
> unofficial re-implementation of FlipAttack (Liu et al.) for anonframework. It is

FlipAttack scrambles the harmful task by flipping it — reversing characters or
words — and then teaches the target, in the same prompt, how to unflip and
follow it. The scrambled task slips past refusal filters that only recognize
plain text, while a capable model still restores and executes it. It is a pure
text transform: no attacker LLM is needed to build the prompt.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/flip_attack"
```

## Usage

```python
from flip_attack_optimizer import FlipAttackOptimizer

# Default rotation starts with FCS (the paper's default mode).
optimizer = FlipAttackOptimizer()

# Paper-faithful single-mode behaviour: configure exactly one flip mode.
optimizer = FlipAttackOptimizer(flip_modes=["FCS"])
```

Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer — see the
framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid) and a
target's README (e.g. `anonframework-target-chatbot`) for a full `Controller.run()` example.
