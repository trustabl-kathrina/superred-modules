## What it does

A collection of 18 prefix-injection templates: each instructs the target to
begin its reply with an affirmative phrase ("Ok, I will help you.", "Mwahahaha…")
and then answer the request, exploiting the finding that a model committed to a
compliant opening tends to continue. Deterministic — no attacker LLM. Upstream
picks one template at random; this optimizer sweeps all of them, one per run.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/jailbroken"
```

## Usage

```python
from jailbroken_optimizer import JailbrokenOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: JailbrokenOptimizer()            # seeded shuffle
optimizer_factory = lambda: JailbrokenOptimizer(shuffle=False)  # file order
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seed` | `0` | shuffle seed for the template order (upstream is unseeded) |
| `shuffle` | `True` | shuffle the order; `False` uses upstream file order |
