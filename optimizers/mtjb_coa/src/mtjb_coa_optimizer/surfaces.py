"""Injection-surface selection for the CoA multi-turn optimizer.

CoA delivers one self-contained user turn per round and continues a single
conversation, so it must pin exactly one controllable -- the human user's
prompt -- and inject every round into that same surface. This is the
name/value-type backstop from ``actor_attack`` (copied per package because
the optimizers are isolated wheels): never inject the reserved system prompt,
and only accept surfaces whose value type carries free-form prose. Unlike
``actor_attack`` this optimizer does not run an LLM surface classifier; it
pins the first eligible free-text surface that fires (documented in
ASSUMPTIONS.md).
