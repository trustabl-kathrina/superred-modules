# Per-file upstream attribution

This directory records the provenance of third-party material redistributed by

lives alongside this file (see `garak-Apache-2.0.txt`). The top-level
`NOTICE` carries the same attribution in prose.

| Vendored into (this module) | garak source |
| --- | --- |
| `DEFAULT_HOMOGLYPH_MAP` in `src/token_smuggling_optimizer/smuggling.py` | `garak/probes/smuggling.py` — `DEFAULT_HOMOGLYPH_MAP` |
| `homoglyph_replace()` in `src/token_smuggling_optimizer/smuggling.py` | `garak/probes/smuggling.py` — `_homoglyph_replace()` |
| `HYPOTHETICAL_TEMPLATE` in `src/token_smuggling_optimizer/smuggling.py` | `garak/probes/smuggling.py` — `HypotheticalResponse.prompts` |
| `UPSTREAM_FUNCTION_MASKING_PROMPT` in `src/token_smuggling_optimizer/smuggling.py` | `garak/probes/smuggling.py` — `FunctionMasking.prompts` (byte-identical, kept as the fallback) |

All three upstream probes are vendored/ported (see `ASSUMPTIONS.md`); the
`FunctionMasking` prompt is kept byte-identical as the fallback. garak credits
the FunctionMasking technique to an austin-stubbs obfuscation survey via its
`smuggling.py` `doc_uri`; that is a taxonomy reference, not a vendored artifact.
