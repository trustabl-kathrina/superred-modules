"""Choose the words a FunctionMasking prompt hides, using the attacker's LLM.

Upstream's ``FunctionMasking`` probe is one fixed prompt whose masked words
("rob", "store") are baked in, so it cannot carry an arbitrary goal. The
scaffolding is reproduced verbatim in :mod:`token_smuggling_optimizer.smuggling`;
this module supplies the only part that has to generalise -- which words of the
goal to hide and how to define them.

Like the shared surface classifier, this degrades to a safe no-op: any failure
returns ``[]``, and the caller then emits upstream's verbatim prompt.
