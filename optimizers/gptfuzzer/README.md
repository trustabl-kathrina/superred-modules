# anonframework-optimizer-gptfuzzer

A **GPTFuzzer** jailbreak optimizer for the
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) red-teaming framework.

GPTFuzzer treats jailbreaking as fuzzing. It starts from a pool of human-written
jailbreak templates, mutates them (crossover, expand, generate-similar,
rephrase, shorten), inserts the harmful goal in place of the template's
`[INSERT PROMPT HERE]` slot, and uses an MCTS-Explore selector plus a RoBERTa
success classifier to keep and grow the templates that work.

## Install

GPTFuzzer's default success classifier is the official `hubert233/GPTFuzz`
RoBERTa model, so this package depends on `torch` and `transformers`; they are
installed automatically.

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/gptfuzzer"
```

The classifier weights are downloaded lazily on the first response-visible run.
If the weights or dependencies are unavailable, the optimizer falls back to a
lightweight refusal-string classifier and logs a warning; set
`allow_predictor_fallback=False` to require the official model and fail the task
instead.

The fallback is scoped to one task, so a host that can never reach the weights
would quietly degrade every task rather than fail. Check the scorer once before
a sweep:

```python
from gptfuzzer_optimizer import RoBERTaPredictor

RoBERTaPredictor().load()  # raises PredictorUnavailableError if unusable
```

## Usage

```python
from gptfuzzer_optimizer import GPTFuzzerOptimizer

# Default budgets follow the official runner (max_query=1000, max_jailbreak=1,
# energy=1) — one mutation, one query per run.
optimizer = GPTFuzzerOptimizer()
```

Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer — see the
framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid) and a
target's README (e.g. `anonframework-target-chatbot`) for a full `Controller.run()` example.
