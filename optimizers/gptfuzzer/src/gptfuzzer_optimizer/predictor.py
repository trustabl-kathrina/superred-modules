    is discarded even though the target already answered. Degrading to the
    refusal-string heuristic is strictly better than that, so any failure of
    the primary predictor activates the fallback.

    The switch is latched for the lifetime of this object, which the framework
    scopes to one task: it keeps every response within a task scored by the
    same classifier, and it avoids retrying a multi-second model load on every
    run. A later task builds a fresh predictor and retries the real model, so a
    transient outage costs one task's scoring fidelity, not the sweep's.
