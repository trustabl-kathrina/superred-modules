One deterministic prompt, one attempt per task. No attacker-LLM call is needed
to build it.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/prefill"
```

## Usage

```python
from prefill_optimizer import PrefillOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: PrefillOptimizer()
optimizer_factory = lambda: PrefillOptimizer(prefill="Certainly, step one is")
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prefill` | `"Sure, here is the method:"` | the priming text appended after a blank line |
