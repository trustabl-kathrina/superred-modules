"""Attacker LLM driver: three prompt modes.

Verbatim ports (modulo formatting) of the three system prompts from
upstream ``framework/attacker.py``:

* :meth:`Attacker.warm_up` — cold start (no library knowledge); used
  on the first epoch and as a fallback when retrieval returns nothing.
* :meth:`Attacker.use_strategy` — present the retrieved strategies
  and their best examples; instruct the attacker to mimic them.
* :meth:`Attacker.find_new_strategy` — present the *ineffective*
  strategies and instruct the attacker to avoid them.

Upstream parses the response by extracting text between
``[START OF JAILBREAK PROMPT]`` and ``[END OF JAILBREAK PROMPT]``
tags. We do the same; on failure we fall back to the bare ``request``
(the raw goal) — same as upstream ``Attacker.wrapper``, so a
rambling attacker that never closed the tag never ships its
rambling to the target. The optimizer applies an additional refusal
filter (``I cannot`` / ``I am unable`` / ``I can't``) on top.

Capability extensions (beyond paper, to align with framework-wide
guidance to use the full scope of capabilities granted by the threat
model):

* ``target_context`` — when in-scope static observables are
  available (e.g. ``model``, ``system_prompt`` readable), they are
  rendered as a ``[TARGET CONTEXT]`` block at the top of the
  attacker's system prompt, so the attacker can tailor its
  persuasion. Falls back to no-context (paper behaviour) when
  empty.
* ``system_prompt_writable`` — when the controller's scope grants
  write access to ``system_prompt``, the attacker is instructed it
  may *optionally* emit a second tagged block,
  ``[START OF SYSTEM PROMPT OVERRIDE] ... [END OF SYSTEM PROMPT
  OVERRIDE]``, which the optimizer will inject into the
  ``system_prompt`` channel alongside the user-message jailbreak.
  When both surfaces are granted, the attacker can hit both.
  Omission is allowed (paper behaviour) and the optimizer
  silently skips the system-prompt channel in that case.
