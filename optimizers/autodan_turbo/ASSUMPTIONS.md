# AutoDAN-Turbo Optimizer — design notes

This document records the design decisions, paper alignment, and
deliberate departures for the AutoDAN-Turbo lifelong-strategy
jailbreak optimizer.

## Algorithm summary

Per epoch on a fixed malicious request `M`:

1. **Attack generation** — pick attacker mode by score-based
   retrieval against the strategy library:
   - empty library (epoch 0, or settings 1/2 where the library
     never grows) → cold `warm_up_attack`
   - retrieval finds high/medium-score strategies (avg ≥ 2.0) →
     `use_strategy(strategies)` with the best examples
   - retrieval finds only low-score strategies (avg < 2.0) →
     `find_new_strategy(strategies)` with strategies to avoid
2. **Refusal filter** — if the attacker output contains
   `I cannot` / `I am unable` / `I can't`, fall back to the raw
   request `M` as the jailbreak prompt.
3. **Probe** — `target.respond(prompt)` → response `R`.
4. **Score** — scorer LLM judges `(M, R)` on a 1.0–10.0 scale; 8.5 is
   the success threshold.
5. **Strategy mining** — if `score > prev_score`, summarizer LLM
   compares `(prev_prompt, current_prompt)`, extracts a
   `{Strategy, Definition}` object, and adds it to the library with
   `Example=current_prompt`, `Score=score-prev_score`.
6. **Update** — `prev_prompt`, `prev_score` ← current.
7. **Stop** — `score ≥ break_score (8.5)`.

## Mapping to anonframework

| Paper construct | AnonFramework surface |
| --- | --- |
| One epoch | One anonframework run |
| Attacker prompt | `ControllablePreCallEvent` for `user_message` (or named override) |
| Target response | `ObservableEvent` on trajectory (preferred), PostCall `answer` fallback |
| Internal scorer | LLM call via the optimizer's `LLMClient` |
| Summarizer | LLM call via `LLMClient`, only when `score > prev_score` |
| Strategy library | In-memory dict, persists across runs of one optimizer instance |
| External judge (when present) | `RunEndEvent.evaluation.success` — additional early-stop |

The library is purely in-memory; persistence (the upstream
`.pkl`/`.json` round-trip) is a workflow concern outside the
optimizer's contract.

## Adversarial information-access settings

The optimizer operates in all four settings without a setting knob —
behaviour is determined by what the framework makes visible.

1. **User query only** (no responses, no eval). No scorer call (no
   response to score), no library updates (no score deltas), no
   retrieval (no prior response to drive mode selection).
   Cold `warm_up` every run; runs to `max_attempts`.
2. **User query + feedback** (no responses, eval visible). Same as 1
   for the inner loop; `RunEndEvent.evaluation.success` triggers
   early-stop.
3. **User query + responses** (responses visible, no eval). The
   internal scorer runs every epoch and is the success signal: stop
   when `score ≥ break_score`. The full lifelong loop engages —
   library updates on score gains, retrieval picks the next attacker
   mode.
4. **User query + responses + feedback**. Full lifelong loop *plus*
   external success early-stop.

## Faithful upstream ports

- **Attacker system prompts** — `warm_up`, `use_strategy`,
  `find_new_strategy` carry the upstream wording (modulo a single
  `[START OF JAILBREAK PROMPT]` / `[END OF JAILBREAK PROMPT]`
  request appended explicitly so the parser is stable across model
  styles; upstream does the same via a prefix-condition mechanic
  specific to its HuggingFace driver).
- **Scorer system prompt** — verbatim, including the 1.0–10.0 scale,
  the 0.5 increments, and the 8.5 success threshold.
- **Summarizer system prompt** — verbatim, including the strategy
  pool listing, the JSON output spec, and the canonical 41-term
  vocabulary the summarizer is encouraged to reuse.
- **Refusal-marker list** — `("I cannot", "I am unable", "I can't")`,
  exactly upstream's `pipeline.py::refusal_list`.
- **Library merge semantics** — adding a strategy with an existing
  name appends `Example` and `Score`, preserving the original
  `Definition` (matches upstream `Library.merge`).
- **Three-tier retrieval logic** — `>=5 → high, [2,5) → medium,
  <2 → low/avoid`, identical thresholds to upstream
  `Retrieval.pop`'s post-faiss filter step (`HIGH_SCORE_THRESHOLD=5`,
  `LOW_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2`).
- **Cold-start fallback in the lifelong path** — when retrieval
  returns no strategies (empty library), the attacker uses
  `warm_up`. Matches upstream `pipeline.py::lifelong_redteaming`.
- **Per-request seed** — `prev_jailbreak_prompt = request`,
  `prev_score = 1.0`. Verbatim from upstream
  `pipeline.lifelong_redteaming` and required for the *first*
  scored attempt to populate the library when it beats the
  raw-goal baseline. Upstream additionally seeds
  `prev_target_response = "Sorry, I cannot help you with that."`
  but that field is never read (neither there nor here — see
  item 8 below), so we don't carry it. Pinned by
  `test_initialize_seeds_prev_state_per_upstream` and
  `test_run_zero_summarizes_when_score_beats_seeded_floor`.
- **Tag-extraction fallback to bare goal** — when the attacker
  output omits `[END OF JAILBREAK PROMPT]`, *or* closes the tag
  around an empty body, `_extract_jailbreak_prompt` returns the
  bare `request` (raw goal), exactly as upstream `Attacker.wrapper`
  does on a failed parse. A rambling attacker that never closed the
  tag does *not* ship its rambling to the target, and an attacker
  that emitted nothing does *not* ship an empty user message
  (litellm's Bedrock Converse transform drops an empty message,
  leaving a conversation the provider rejects outright). Pinned by
  `test_falls_back_to_request_when_no_end_tag`,
  `test_falls_back_to_request_on_empty_output`,
  `test_falls_back_to_request_on_an_empty_tag_body` and
  `test_jailbreak_prompt_is_never_blank`.
- **No temperature is sent**: the paper's pins (attacker 1.0,
  scorer 0.7, summarizer 0.6) are deliberately not passed to the
  LLM. Reasoning models reject the parameter outright and Bedrock
  Claude rejects it alongside `top_p`, so pinning it would make the
  optimizer unusable on exactly the strongest attacker models.
- **A failed scorer leaves the attempt unscored** — the paper
  assumes the scorer answers. When it does not, the call is retried
  twice (transient provider failures only; `BudgetExhaustedError`
  is re-raised immediately, a permanent failure is not retried), and
  if it still fails the attempt is left unscored: `prev_score` and
  `prev_prompt` keep describing the last attempt that was actually
  measured. The earlier behaviour reused `prev_score` as this
  attempt's score, which can never beat `prev_score`, so the
  library stopped growing while the run still looked healthy and
  `prev_prompt` advanced to a prompt no scorer had seen. A task in
  which the scorer never once succeeded is logged at ERROR: it
  measured a degraded attacker, not a weak one.
- **Default `break_score = 8.5`** — paper / run-script.
- **Default `top_k_strategies = 5`** — matches upstream
  `Retrieval.pop` default `k=5`.

## Threat-model fidelity: full use of in-scope capabilities

Per the framework-wide guidance to *"automatically utilize the full
scope of capabilities granted by the threat model, even when slightly
beyond the original publication"*, the optimizer reads everything in
scope that the LLM-driven attacker can naturally absorb and degrades
silently to the paper-faithful path when a surface is absent.
Concretely:

- **All in-scope static observables → attacker side-info.**
  `initialize` captures every observable whose content is a
  non-empty string into a `target_context: dict[str, str]` and
  threads it through to all three attacker modes (`warm_up` /
  `use_strategy` / `find_new_strategy`). The attacker prepends a
  `[TARGET CONTEXT]` block to its system prompt listing each
  observable name and value, and is instructed to use the info to
  tailor its persuasion (reference the target's stated persona,
  exploit known weaknesses of the target model family, subvert the
  visible system prompt's defenses). When `target_context` is
  empty / `None`, the attacker reverts to the paper-faithful
  goal-only system prompt (no `[TARGET CONTEXT]` block at all).
  This generalises to any observable the controller exposes —
  `model`, `system_prompt` readable, anything else a target
  surfaces. Pinned by `TestTargetContextPropagation` (5 tests:
  empty observables, captured-into-dict, empty-string drop,
  passed-to-warm_up, passed-to-use_strategy) and
  `TestTargetContextBlock` (5 tests: rendered block contents and
  presence across all three attacker modes).

- **System-prompt write access → dual-channel attack.** When the
  controller's scope grants write access to `system_prompt` *and*
  the user did not set an explicit `target_controllable_name`,
  the attacker is informed via a `system_prompt_writable=True`
  flag that it may *optionally* emit a second tagged block,
  `[START OF SYSTEM PROMPT OVERRIDE] ... [END OF SYSTEM PROMPT
  OVERRIDE]`. The optimizer parses this block out of the
  attacker's response (separately from the existing
  `[START/END OF JAILBREAK PROMPT]` extraction), stores it as
  `_current_system_prompt_override`, and injects it into the
  `system_prompt` `ControllablePreCallEvent`. The user-message
  jailbreak still goes to `user_message` as in the paper — both
  surfaces granted by the threat model are used. When the attacker
  *omits* the optional block (paper-faithful behaviour), the
  `system_prompt` PreCall passes through with no injection. When
  the scope grants only `user_message`, the
  `system_prompt_writable` flag stays `False` and the attacker
  isn't asked for an override at all (token-efficient: no wasted
  attacker capacity on a channel we can't use). Pinned by
  `TestDualChannelAttack` (10 tests: writable detection,
  user-only-scope, explicit-override-disables-dual-channel,
  signal-passed-to-attacker, override-injected,
  no-override-passes-through, scope-doesn't-grant-write-defends,
  injected-once-per-run, refusal-filter-drops-override,
  user-message-unchanged) and
  `TestSystemPromptWritableSignal` (5 tests: signal-omits-block,
  signal-adds-instructions, override-extracted, false-flag-drops-emitted-override,
  attacker-omits-block-returns-none).

- **Refusal filter applies to both channels.** When the attacker's
  user-message output trips the refusal filter (`I cannot` / `I am
  unable` / `I can't`), the raw goal replaces the user-message
  jailbreak (paper behaviour) *and* the system-prompt override is
  dropped — we don't ship a refusal-shaped override to the system
  channel either. Pinned by `test_refusal_filter_drops_override_too`.

- **Response observables → consumed as success signal (paper).**
  The internal scorer reads target responses from the trajectory
  (preferred) or PostCall fallback to drive library updates and
  break-score early-stop. This is the paper's success path and is
  unchanged.

## Deliberate departures

### 1. No embedding-based retrieval (v1 simplification)

Upstream's `Retrieval` (`framework/retrival.py`) embeds the prior
target response with OpenAI text-embeddings, builds a faiss
`IndexFlatL2`, and ranks strategies by L2 similarity to the response
embedding before applying the score-tier filter. We drop the
embedding step entirely in v1:

- AnonFramework's `LLMClient` is a text-completion client. There is no
  embedding API on it, and adding hard dependencies on `faiss` and
  `numpy` (plus an embedding model + API key) would inflate a slim
  optimizer module by an order of magnitude.
- The score-tier filter (`>=5 → high, [2,5) → medium, <2 → avoid`) is
  the actual decision boundary for which attacker mode runs next; the
  embedding step only changes *which* of several entries within the
  same tier is shown to the attacker.

In v1 we rank strategies by **average score** across all examples
(the same field the embedding step ultimately relies on after
similarity ranking) and return the highest-scoring ones, capped at
`top_k_strategies`. This preserves the tri-modal `use_strategy` /
`find_new_strategy` / cold-start decision exactly. Embedding-based
ranking can be added later as an optional plug-in (e.g.
`StrategyLibrary` subclass) without touching the optimizer state
machine.

### 2. Lifelong-only path (no separate warm-up stage)

Upstream's pipeline runs a `warm_up → build_from_warm_up_log →
lifelong_redteaming` sequence. The warm-up phase collects a flat
attack log per request, then post-hoc summarises strategies by
comparing the lowest- and highest-scoring entries per request. This
is a workflow detail for batch experiments (collect a log, summarise
at the end).

AnonFramework is online: each run sees one Goal, the library starts empty,
and the lifelong loop subsumes warm-up cleanly — the very first run
does `warm_up` (matches upstream's epoch-0 path inside
`lifelong_redteaming`), and library entries accumulate as score
improvements are observed run-by-run.

### 3. Single-line score parser instead of two-stage scorer LLM

Upstream's scorer makes *two* LLM calls per epoch: a "scoring" call
that returns a free-form analysis containing a number, then a
"wrapper" call that asks a smaller LLM to extract just the number.
We replace the wrapper call with a regex parser:

- Halves scorer cost (every epoch makes a scorer call).
- The wrapper's prompt is one line (`extract the score and output
  only the number`); a regex is at least as reliable on well-formed
  scorer output and falls back gracefully on noise.
- We additionally instruct the scorer system prompt to end with
  `Score: <number>` to give the regex a stable anchor.

### 4. Single-line `{Strategy, Definition}` parser instead of two-stage summarizer

Same trade-off: upstream calls the summarizer twice — once for
analysis, once for JSON extraction. We extract the JSON via regex
(prefer the literal `{"Strategy": ..., "Definition": ...}` shape,
fall back to fenced code blocks, then any `{...}` substring). On
parse failure we return `None` and the optimizer skips the library
update for that run, matching upstream's "retry-then-skip" semantics.

### 5. No multi-request iteration

Upstream iterates over a list of `data['lifelong']` requests. AnonFramework
optimisers operate on one `Goal`. The optimiser keeps `prev_prompt /
prev_score` per Goal — exactly the per-request state upstream maintains
inside the lifelong loop.

### 8. Holding `_prev_prompt` / `_prev_score` instead of reading from `past_trajectories`

The base `Optimizer` already exposes `past_trajectories` via
`_dispatch`. We deliberately keep the two `_prev_*` fields
because (a) `_prev_score` is the scorer LLM's output and is *not*
on the trajectory at all; recomputing it from past responses
would mean re-running the scorer LLM each epoch; (b) `_prev_prompt`
is the optimizer-side jailbreak the attacker emitted, which lives
inside the `ControllablePreCallEvent` ↔ `ControllableInjection`
pair on the trajectory but is much cheaper to keep in two
flat fields than to re-scan the full trajectory each epoch;
(c) the per-Goal seed in `initialize()` would still need
explicit storage anyway. The duplication is intentional and
load-bearing.

(Upstream also carries `prev_target_response` alongside these
two; we dropped it because nothing in either codebase ever
reads it — see "Per-request seed" above.)

### 9. Default `max_attempts = 10` (vs paper's 150 for batch experiments)

The paper budgets 150 epochs per request for a batch experiment with
a strategy library being progressively built across 50 requests.
AnonFramework runs are typically interactive single-Goal sessions; 10
matches the merged-optimizer norm (Crescendo, GOAT, Bijection all in
that range). Callers can set `max_attempts=150` for batch-style
experiments.

## Constructor surface

| Argument | Default | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_attempts` | `10` | merged-optimizer norm (paper batches use 150) |
| `break_score` | `8.5` | paper / run script |
| `top_k_strategies` | `5` | matches upstream `Retrieval.pop` default `k=5` |
| `response_observable_names` | `{"response","model_response","assistant_response"}` | matches Crescendo / GEPA / GOAT / Bijection |
| `target_controllable_name` | `None` | optional named-controllable override; `None` enables the dual-channel extension when scope grants `system_prompt` write access |
| `max_no_signal_runs` | `0` (disabled) | blind-loop guard |

## Test coverage

114 tests total. Coverage:

- **Library**: add / merge / retrieve at each of the three score
  tiers; empty-library, k-cap, score-strip behaviour.
- **Attacker**: warm-up / use-strategy (single + multi) /
  find-new-strategy system-prompt rendering; START/END tag
  extraction; empty-strategy fall-through; raw-`request` fallback
  when the END tag is missing or output is empty (matches
  upstream `Attacker.wrapper`).
- **Attacker capability extensions**:
  `[TARGET CONTEXT]` block rendered/omitted across all three modes
  based on `target_context`;
  system-prompt-override block extraction (matched, unmatched,
  empty, no-tags-at-all);
  `system_prompt_writable=True` adds the override-block
  instructions to the system prompt;
  `system_prompt_writable=False` strips any emitted override
  (defends against smuggling).
- **Scorer**: keyword-anchored / fall-through / clamped score parsing;
  request and response embedding; no temperature in the LLM call.
- **Summarizer**: inline-object / fenced-block / escaped-string
  parsing; missing-field returns `None`; no temperature in the LLM
  call.
- **Optimizer**: construction validation; first run uses warm-up,
  subsequent runs use retrieval; per-run state reset; user-vs-system
  PreCall lock; `target_controllable_name` override; trajectory >
  PostCall response source; scorer-failure resilience; refusal
  fallback to raw goal; library-update gating on score improvement;
  summarizer-`None` skip; break-score early-stop; external eval
  early-stop; failure eval continues; all four adversarial settings;
  `max_no_signal_runs`; ChatbotTarget-style end-to-end; upstream
  per-request `prev_*` seeding (`prev_score=1.0`,
  `prev_prompt=goal`) and run-zero library population when score
  beats the seeded floor.
- **Capability utilization (beyond paper)**:
  *Target-context propagation*: empty-observables yields empty
  `_target_context`; observables → captured into dict (and
  `None` is passed when empty so the attacker wire-format is
  unambiguous); empty-string observables dropped; threaded into
  all three attacker modes.
  *Dual-channel attack*: writable-flag detected from controllable
  scope; user-only-scope → flag stays `False`; explicit
  `target_controllable_name` disables the dual-channel extension;
  attacker informed via `system_prompt_writable=True`; emitted
  override → injected into `system_prompt` PreCall; omitted
  override → PreCall passes through (paper-faithful);
  scope-doesn't-grant-write → defensive PreCall NoInjection;
  override injected at most once per run; refusal filter drops
  the override too (no refusal smuggling); user-message
  injection is unchanged when only the override extension is
  active.
