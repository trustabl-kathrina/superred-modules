## What it does

DeepInception hypnotises a model with a nested fiction: a scene whose
characters recursively create their own scenes, layer by layer, and at each
layer propose a step toward the goal "against the super evil doctor". The
harmful request is buried several imagined layers deep, which slips past a
model's normal refusal. One prompt per run; no LLM calls.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/deepinception"
```

## Usage

```python
from deepinception_optimizer import DeepInceptionOptimizer

# README defaults: a "dream", 5 characters, 5 layers
optimizer_factory = lambda: DeepInceptionOptimizer()

# the paper also uses other scenes / depths
optimizer_factory = lambda: DeepInceptionOptimizer(
    scene="science fiction", character_number=6, layer_number=4
)
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scene` | `dream` | fiction type (README default) |
| `character_number` | `5` | characters per layer |
| `layer_number` | `5` | nesting depth to reach |

The goal fills the template's query slot; the prompt is injected once into the
first free-text non-`system_prompt` surface, and the run ends after one attempt.
