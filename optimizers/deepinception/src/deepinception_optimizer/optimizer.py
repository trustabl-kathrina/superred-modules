"""DeepInceptionOptimizer: nest the goal inside a layered fiction.

Ports the DeepInception jailbreak (tmlr-group/DeepInception, MIT): wrap the
adversarial goal in a nested "dream/science-fiction" scene that recurses for
several layers, asking characters to propose steps toward the goal. One prompt
per run; no LLM calls.
