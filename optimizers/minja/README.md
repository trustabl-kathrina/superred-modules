# anonframework-optimizer-minja

A **MINJA (Memory INJection Attack)** optimizer for
[anonframework](https://example.invalid) agent targets.

MINJA poisons an LLM agent's long-term memory using only ordinary queries — no
privileged access. Across a series of innocuous-looking questions it plants a
"bridge" memory record that links a victim term to an attacker-chosen target.
Later, when a clean victim query is asked, the agent retrieves the poisoned
memory and produces the attacker's target instead.

Interaction," [arXiv:2503.03704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704)
(NeurIPS 2025). Official implementation:
[`dsh3n77/MINJA`](https://github.com/dsh3n77/MINJA). See
[ASSUMPTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS.md) for the full paper-to-code mapping and every
deliberate departure.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/minja"
```

## Usage

```python
from minja_optimizer import MinjaOptimizer

# By default the scenario (victim -> target pair, bridge, questions) is derived
# from the anonframework goal and visible observables. Defaults inject_num=15,
# num_benign=50, test_num=30 match the official rap/minja.py.
optimizer = MinjaOptimizer()

# Supply an explicit scenario for exact custom content.
from minja_optimizer import MinjaScenario, VictimTargetPair
optimizer = MinjaOptimizer(scenario=MinjaScenario(...))
```

This optimizer targets **agent-style** targets whose memory persists across runs
within a task. Wire it into a `Controller` like any other anonframework optimizer —
see the framework's [architecture overview](https://example.invalid).

MIT for this port's code (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The upstream reference
implementation, [`dsh3n77/MINJA`](https://github.com/dsh3n77/MINJA), is MIT
licensed. The bundled RAP/WebShop scenario data originates from that repository;
it is credited in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) and the upstream MIT copyright notice is
preserved in [`LICENSES/MINJA-MIT.txt`](LICENSES/MINJA-MIT.txt). This port
reimplements the attack against anonframework's event model rather than vendoring
upstream runtime source.
