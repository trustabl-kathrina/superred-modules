# MINJA Optimizer Assumptions

This module implements MINJA ("Memory Injection Attacks on LLM Agents via
Query-Only Interaction") for AnonFramework agent targets.

The attack is **scenario-driven**: a `MinjaScenario` bundles the victim term, the
target term, the progressive-shortening indication prompts, the bridge
(memory-record) template, and the attacker's victim questions. By default the
optimizer derives this scenario at `initialize()` time from the AnonFramework goal and
visible static observables. If those clearly point at the paper's RAP/WebShop
setup, it uses the official RAP content; otherwise it builds a deterministic
victim -> target bridge from phrases such as "redirect X to Y". If neither is
available, initialization fails loudly and asks for a victim/target pair instead
of silently running an unrelated fallback. Supplying an explicit `MinjaScenario`
still overrides derivation when a caller wants exact custom content.

## What matches the paper and official code

- The default scenario is built from official RAP/WebShop data: the
  victim -> target pair (`toothbrush` -> `DenTek …`, price 20) from
  `rap/victim_target_pair/victim_target.json`, the five indication prompts (used
  longest to shortest) from `rap/indication_prompt_template.json`, and a compact
  packaged subset of `rap/webshop_instructions.json` containing exactly the rows
  that mention an official victim term — the data the optimizer actually reads.
- The bridge/memory record follows the official
  `(attack_query, [bridging_steps, target_reasoning_steps])` shape.
- Defaults `inject_num=15`, `num_benign=50`, `test_num=30` match `rap/minja.py`.
  `num_benign` only takes effect when benign queries are supplied by the caller
  or target setup; the large upstream WebShop benign pool is not bundled here.
- Progressive Shortening Strategy: each victim query is injected first with the
  full indication prompt, then with progressively shorter ones, ending with the
  plain victim query.
- Success means the target term appears in the agent's output, measured only on
  a *trigger* run (a clean victim query with no indication prompt), so it
  reflects memory retrieval rather than an injected instruction. AnonFramework
  framework evaluation is authoritative when present; the no-feedback fallback
  checks visible response/action/tool-call trajectory items and also requires
  the victim term to be *absent* (a real switch), matching the upstream
  target-without-victim action check as closely as AnonFramework visibility allows.
- If no official RAP/WebShop term is visible, `MinjaOptimizer()` is still
  self-sufficient when the goal or static context clearly names a victim ->
  target redirection. It then creates varied trigger queries and uses a generic
  progressive bridge. This follows MINJA's procedure but is not a published
  WebShop content setting.

## How it maps to AnonFramework

- **Connected runs.** Injection runs poison the target's **durable** memory,
  which survives `reset_ephemeral_state()` between runs within a task; a later
  trigger run issues a clean victim query that retrieves it. Durable state is
  cleared only when the controller gets a fresh target from the `TargetFactory`
  between tasks, so each task starts unpoisoned. A target whose memory does not
  persist across runs cannot be attacked by MINJA, by construction.
- **Injection point.** The victim query goes into the first PreCall controllable
  that is not a capability surface (system prompt, tool-catalog edits) or the
  model's response slot — discovered at runtime, with no field-name assumptions —
  mirroring the `target_controllable_name`/primary-latch convention of the other
  optimizers (CodeChameleon, AutoDAN-Turbo). `target_controllable_name` locks the
  channel explicitly and (as there) disables the capability extensions for a
  strictly query-only run.
- One AnonFramework run is one MINJA query. If framework feedback is visible it is the
  authoritative trigger-run signal; otherwise the optimizer checks the trigger
  response for the target term; with neither, it runs open-loop.

## AnonFramework capability extensions (beyond the paper's query-only setting)

These fire only on injection stages, and only when the threat model grants the
surface; benign and test stages stay plain.

- Writable `system_prompt`: adds a short MINJA note plus the current memory
  record.
- Memory/content/tool PostCall surfaces in scope: appends the current memory
  record to them.
- Writable tool catalog: registers, replaces, or rewrites a memory-like
  retrieval tool so the agent sees the record.
- Static observables (model identity, system prompt, tool catalog) are used when
  visible, with a size cap so long metadata does not crowd out the attack text.
- Optional LLM scenario synthesis (`use_llm_scenario_synthesis=True`): if
  deterministic extraction cannot find a victim -> target pair, the optimizer
  can ask the AnonFramework LLM to infer one from the goal/static context. For
  non-official derived scenarios, it can then ask the LLM to create richer victim
  questions and memory-record text. This is off by default for determinism, cost
  control, and cleaner paper comparison. It never overrides an explicit
  `MinjaScenario`, and official RAP/WebShop scenarios keep the official content
  unless the caller supplies a custom scenario.

## Deliberate differences from the official code

- **Generality.** The optimizer is scenario-parameterized (see above); the
  paper's WebShop content is the default when the visible context asks for that
  setting, and generic victim -> target scenarios are derived automatically
  otherwise when the objective is clear. Ambiguous goals fail fast rather than
  guessing. The package ships only the data the optimizer reads (the three RAP
  files), not the full WebShop / QA / EHR corpora — those belong with a target if
  one needs them.
- **LLM-synthesized pair/content is opt-in.** The paper uses fixed scenario
  content. The optional LLM path is a AnonFramework enhancement for non-WebShop
  targets where regex extraction is too narrow and more natural domain-specific
  questions and memory text may improve attack success.
- **Benign controls.** Optional `benign_queries` (capped by `num_benign`)
  interleave benign instructions, since AnonFramework usually runs one task at a time.
- **No duplicate loop knobs.** AnonFramework targets own their internal step loop and
  run/retry budgets, so MINJA exposes no `num_steps` and does its own per-run
  scheduling rather than the official 3x retry.
- **Budget-robust schedule.** Instead of all-injection-then-all-test, MINJA
  injects one full victim query as a warmup, then interleaves triggers through
  the rest, so a run/cost cap still reaches a trigger. For a single injection
  query the order is unchanged (inject, then trigger).
- **Budget-adaptive (default `adaptive=True`).** It stops early when the target
  shows no sign of a memory (no memory/tool surface and a short
  `probe_trigger_budget` probe that never retrieves), and keeps injecting and
  triggering past the fixed schedule when the target does have a memory, until
  the goal is met or the controller's run/cost budget runs out. Pass
  `adaptive=False` for the paper's fixed open-loop schedule.
