"""Stdlib drop-in for ReNeLLM's ``utils/llm_completion_utils`` helper.

Upstream's ``utils/llm_completion_utils.py`` builds ``openai``/``anthropic``
SDK clients. That file is the *only* upstream util we do not vendor: it is
replaced by this shim so the byte-identical vendored rewrite/judge helpers
(which do ``from utils.llm_completion_utils import chatCompletion``) route every
model call through the constrained anonframework ``LLMClient`` instead.

The shim keeps upstream's ``chatCompletion`` signature verbatim so the vendored
callers bind to it unchanged, but ignores every routing / sampling / credential
knob: the anonframework ``LLMClient`` owns the model and credentials, and no sampling
parameter is ever set by this package (house rule; see
``tests/test_no_temperature.py``). Only ``messages`` is forwarded.

The forwarding target is a per-call *bridge* stored in :data:`BRIDGE`. The
optimizer sets it (in its async context) before invoking the synchronous
vendored helpers; ``asyncio.to_thread`` copies the context into the worker
thread, where the vendored code runs and calls back through the bridge to the
event loop. ``claudeCompletion`` (the upstream *attacked-model* helper) is
deliberately absent: the model under attack is reached via anonframework injection,
never through this shim.
