"""Injection-surface selection for the ReNeLLM optimizer.

ReNeLLM delivers a single self-contained *user* prompt (a rewritten goal nested
inside a benign code/table/story scenario) and reads the model's reply. It is a
single-turn user-input attack, so it injects into a free-text user surface and
never into the reserved system prompt (which would clobber a Task-configured
system prompt and does not match the technique). This is the name/value-type
backstop shared across the optimizer ports (copied per package because each
optimizer ships as an isolated wheel).
