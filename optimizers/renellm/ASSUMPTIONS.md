# ASSUMPTIONS & DEVIATIONS

Deliberate deviations from upstream ReNeLLM (`NJUNLP/ReNeLLM` @ `a61c39e`) made
while porting it to anonframework's event-driven `Optimizer`. Upstream is the
authoritative source for the technique; this document records where the port
differs and why.

## Event-model mapping (pre-send, no rewind)

- **One anonframework *run* == one ReNeLLM outer iteration.** Upstream `renellm.py`
  loops per behaviour up to `iter_max`, and every iteration re-rewrites from the
  *original* goal (`harm_behavior` is reset to `temp_harm_behavior` after each
  failed jailbreak). This port produces a fresh rewrite+nest on each `RunStart`
  from `goal.description`, so runs are independent iterations. `iter_max` maps to
  the number of runs before the optimizer reports `done` (upstream default 20).
- **The rewritten+nested prompt is produced pre-send.** Upstream rewrites, nests,
  *then* queries the attacked model within one iteration. anonframework has no
  mid-conversation rewind, so the rewrite-until-harmful loop and scenario nesting
  run entirely inside the `RunStart` handler; the finished nested prompt is
  injected at the first eligible `ControllablePreCall`. Nothing is rewritten
  after a send.
- **The model under attack is the target, not an optimizer-built client.**
  Upstream's `claudeCompletion(attack_model, nested_prompt, ...)` is replaced by
  injecting `nested_prompt` on the target's controllable surface and reading the
  reply from `ControllablePostCall.answer` (with a trajectory-observable
  fallback). Upstream's `--attack_model`/`--claude_*` parameters and the entire
  anthropic client path are dropped.
- **`ControllablePostCall` always returns `ControllableNoInjection`.** This
  attack reads the reply but never rewrites the target's answer; the channel type
  requires an explicit injection decision, so it declines every post-call.

## Auxiliary LLM routing (rewrite + judge via self.llm)

- Upstream uses `--rewrite_model` (default `gpt-3.5-turbo`) for the six rewrite
  operations and `--judge_model` for the harmful-classification judge. In this
  port **both roles are the single constrained `self.llm`** (anonframework's
  `LLMClient`). The judge is used, as upstream, for two things: (a) confirming a
  rewrite is still harmful, and (b) scoring the target reply.
- **Upstream `utils/llm_completion_utils.py` is the only util not vendored.** It
  builds `openai`/`anthropic` SDK clients; it is replaced by
  `src/renellm_optimizer/_shim.py`, a stdlib `chatCompletion` with the identical
  signature that forwards only `messages` to `self.llm`. The vendored helpers
  import it via `from utils.llm_completion_utils import chatCompletion`
  unchanged.
- **No sampling temperature is ever sent** (house rule; see
  `tests/test_no_temperature.py`). Upstream's rewrite operations pass
  `random.uniform(0, 1)` and the judge passes `args.temperature` (default 0) to
  the SDK helper; the shim drops both, so `self.llm` uses each provider's
  default. This is the documented reason the rewrite may occasionally fail the
  still-harmful check and be retried.

## Synchronous vendored code bridged to async self.llm

- The vendored rewrite/judge helpers are **synchronous**. They are executed in a
  worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread`; each model call hops back to the event
  loop with `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(self.llm.complete(...), loop)`. The
  bridge is passed through a `contextvars.ContextVar` (copied into the worker by
  `to_thread`), so the module-level vendored `chatCompletion` reaches the right
  optimizer instance's client. The shim mirrors upstream's `.strip()` on the
  returned content.
- Upstream's `round_sleep` / `fail_sleep` / `retry_times` and their
  `time.sleep()` calls live only in the replaced SDK helper and are dropped;
  retry/backoff is `self.llm`'s responsibility.

## Rewrite-retry loop is bounded

- Upstream's inner rewrite loop is `while True`: it retries indefinitely until
  the judge labels the rewrite harmful (relying on the random temperature to
  eventually produce one). This port caps it at `max_rewrite_attempts` (default
  20); on exhaustion it uses the last rewritten candidate so a nested prompt is
  still produced. This prevents an unbounded loop when the judge never returns
  `"1"` (e.g. a mocked or unusually conservative judge).

## Preserved upstream behaviours

- **Refusal short-circuit, verbatim.** Before judging a reply, upstream skips the
  judge when the reply looks like a refusal:
  `"apologize" not in output and "sorry" not in output.lower()`. This asymmetric
  casing (`apologize` matched case-sensitively, `sorry` case-insensitively) is
  reproduced exactly.
- **Rewrite operation selection.** A random count `randint(1, 6)` and a random
  order `sample(range(6), n)` of the six operations, applied in sequence,
  matching upstream. Selection uses a seedable RNG for reproducibility; the
  vendored `shortenSentence` candidate pick still uses the global `random`
  module, as upstream.
- **Scenario nesting.** A random choice among the three vendored scenarios, with
  `<>` replaced by the rewritten goal (`scenario.replace("<>", ...)`).

## Injection surface

- ReNeLLM is a **single-turn user-input** attack. It injects only into a
  free-text user surface and never into the reserved `system_prompt` (which would
  clobber a Task-configured system prompt and does not match the technique). If
  `target_controllable_name` is set, only that surface is used; otherwise the
  first eligible free-text surface is pinned for the run.

## Stop / continue and error handling

- **Success** ends the attack (`done=True`): either the vendored judge labels the
  reply harmful, or the framework `RunEndEvent.evaluation.success` is `True` (a
  framework success verdict is authoritative). Otherwise the run continues until
  `iter_max`.
- **No-progress guard.** If no eligible surface fires in a run (e.g. a
  system-prompt-only target) or no payload could be produced, the optimizer
  reports `done=True` rather than spinning the full budget injecting nothing.
- **Budget / transient errors.** A genuine `BudgetExhaustedError` with non-zero
  spent cost propagates (a spent run must not be reported as a clean finish); the
  zero-cost noop client handed to non-LLM optimizers degrades quietly (no
  injection). Any other transient auxiliary-LLM failure ends the current run
  (no injection / non-success), not the sweep.

## Not ported (out of scope for the optimizer)

- The AdvBench dataset reader and `data/advbench/harmful_behaviors.csv` are not
  vendored: the goal is supplied by anonframework as `goal.description`, so the
  rewrite/nest paths load no data files. (`data_utils.py` is still vendored
  because `prompt_rewrite_utils` imports `remove_number_prefix` from it.)
- Upstream's `llama/`, `defense/`, `get_responses.py`, `check_gpt_asr.py`,
  `check_kw_asr.py`, `renellm_tcps.py`, and all `torch`/`transformers` code paths
  are not bundled. Result-file JSON persistence and temp-file checkpointing are
  handled by anonframework's trajectory/persistence layer instead.

## Vendored-code execution hygiene

- Because the vendored files use absolute `from utils.X import Y` imports that
  cannot be edited, `vendored.load()` installs a private `utils` package (plus
  the shim as `utils.llm_completion_utils`) into `sys.modules` only for the
  duration of one hermetic import, then restores `sys.modules`. The imported
  module objects keep working afterwards because their imported names are bound
  at import time. The load is cached and guarded by a lock.
