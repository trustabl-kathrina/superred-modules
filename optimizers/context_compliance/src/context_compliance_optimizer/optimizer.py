"""ContextComplianceOptimizer: the Context Compliance Attack (CCA) for anonframework.

Ports the ``context_compliance`` technique from microsoft/PyRIT (MIT), pinned at
commit ``2016c4a``. CCA (Russinovich & Salem, "Jailbreaking is (Mostly) Simpler
Than You Think", arXiv:2503.05264) fabricates a benign prior exchange -- a
neutral user question about the objective's topic and an affirmative assistant
answer that offers to carry out the objective -- then sends the real request, so
the target "complies with its own prior context".

At ``initialize`` the fabricated exchange is built once, from the two vendored
PyRIT templates, with both adversarial generations routed through the
constrained ``self.llm``:

* the adversarial persona (``context_compliance.yaml``) turns the objective into
  the benign opening user question ``Q``;
* the simulated target (``context_compliance_target.yaml``) answers ``Q`` with
  the fabricated affirmative assistant turn ``A``.

The framework exposes no primitive for injecting prior conversation turns, so
the fabricated ``[user Q][assistant A][user real-request]`` history is encoded
into a single free-text user-message injection (a labelled transcript) on a
conversation surface -- never the system prompt. See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for this
and every other deliberate deviation, including how the final real request is
chosen.

The prompt bodies are loaded from the byte-identical vendored YAML; none are
reproduced here.
