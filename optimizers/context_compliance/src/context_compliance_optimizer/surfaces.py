"""Injection-surface selection for the context-compliance optimizer.

CCA delivers its fabricated conversation as one self-contained user turn (see
``conversation.py`` and ASSUMPTIONS.md), so the optimizer injects into a single
free-text surface that carries prose -- never the reserved system prompt. This
is the name/value-type backstop shared across the single-turn ports (copied per
package because the optimizers are isolated wheels): the fabricated prior turns
belong in the conversation the user drives, not in a Task-configured system
prompt, and a json/number surface would discard a prose transcript.

No LLM surface classifier is run; the first eligible free-text surface is used
(documented in ASSUMPTIONS.md).
