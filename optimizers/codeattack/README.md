# anonframework-optimizer-codeattack

CodeAttack code-completion jailbreak optimizer for
[anonframework](https://example.invalid).

> **Community port — not an official implementation.** This module vendors the
> code templates from [renqibing/CodeAttack](https://github.com/renqibing/CodeAttack)
> (MIT) and reproduces its tokenisation. Not affiliated with the authors. See
> [ASSUMPTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS.md).

## What it does

CodeAttack hides the request inside a code-completion task: the goal is
tokenised into a Python data structure (a list, a stack/`deque`, or a string)
embedded in a code snippet, and the model is asked to "follow the comments and
complete the code" — decoding and acting on the smuggled request. One prompt
per run; no LLM calls.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/codeattack"
```

## Usage

```python
from codeattack_optimizer import CodeAttackOptimizer

# python_stack (upstream's headline variant)
optimizer_factory = lambda: CodeAttackOptimizer()

# encode the goal as an ordered list, or a plain string
optimizer_factory = lambda: CodeAttackOptimizer(variant="python_list")
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `variant` | `python_stack` | `python_stack`, `python_list`, or `python_string` |

`python_list` appends the goal's words in order; `python_stack` appends them
reversed (a stack pops in order); `python_string` embeds the whole goal. The
rendered prompt is injected once into the first free-text non-`system_prompt`
surface, and the run ends after one attempt.
