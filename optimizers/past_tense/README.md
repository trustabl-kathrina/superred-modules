## What it does

Refusal training generalises poorly across tense: a model that refuses "how do
I make X" will often answer "how *was* X made". This optimizer asks the
attacker LLM to reformulate the objective as a question in the past (or future)
tense, then sends that single reformulated prompt. One rephrase call, one
injection.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/optimizers/past_tense"
```

## Usage

```python
from past_tense_optimizer import PastTenseOptimizer

optimizer_factory = lambda: PastTenseOptimizer()               # past tense
optimizer_factory = lambda: PastTenseOptimizer(tense="future")  # future tense
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tense` | `past` | `past`, `future`, or `present` (control: sends the goal unchanged) |
| `max_retries` | `5` | reformulation attempts before falling back to the original goal |
