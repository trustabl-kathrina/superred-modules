"""PastTenseOptimizer: rephrase the goal into the past (or future) tense.

Ports the past/future tense attack as implemented in Tencent AI-Infra-Guard
(``AIG-PromptSecurity/deepteam/attacks/single_turn/past_tense``, Apache-2.0).
The attacker LLM reformulates the objective as a question in the past or future
tense, which slips past refusal training keyed to present-tense requests. One
rephrase call, one injection.

Based on Tencent Zhuque Lab AI-Infra-Guard
(https://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guard).

Technique: Andriushchenko & Flammarion, "Does Refusal Training in LLMs
Generalize to the Past Tense?" (2024).

See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for every deliberate deviation.
