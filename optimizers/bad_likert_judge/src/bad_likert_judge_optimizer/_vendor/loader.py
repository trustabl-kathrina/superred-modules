"""Load DeepTeam's Bad Likert Judge templates without forking them.

``deepteam_blj/template.py`` is a byte-identical copy of upstream, so it keeps
upstream's absolute import::

    from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn.base_template import BaseMultiTurnTemplate

Rather than edit that line (which would fork the file and break
``sync_upstream.py``), the loader registers the vendored ``base_template`` under
exactly that module name before executing the template. Only the two module
names DeepTeam's import needs are registered, and only if nothing already
occupies them -- so a real ``deepteam`` installation in the same environment is
never shadowed.
