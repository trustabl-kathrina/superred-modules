"""Injection-surface selection for single-prompt jailbreak optimizers.

Copied per-package (the optimizers are isolated wheels that cannot import one
another), alongside ``surface_llm.py``.

These attackers deliver **one self-contained prompt** that must reach the model
as the human user's own instruction -- the jailbreak scaffolding only works if
the model reads it as the request it is answering. A name table alone cannot
find that surface on an arbitrary target, so
``surface_llm.classify_controllables`` reads each surface's own description and
says which one is the user's prompt. The name/value-type rules below remain as
the backstop, used verbatim when classification is unavailable (no LLM budget,
malformed reply, any failure -> ``{}``).
