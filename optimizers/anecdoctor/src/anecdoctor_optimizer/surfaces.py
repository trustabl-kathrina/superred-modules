"""Injection-surface selection for the Anecdoctor optimizer.

Anecdoctor delivers a single framed request that carries the misinformation
framing (upstream's system prompt) folded into one user turn together with the
few-shot claims or the extracted knowledge graph. It therefore needs exactly
one free-text user surface. This is the name/value-type backstop shared across
the single-turn optimizers (copied per package because the optimizers are
isolated wheels): never inject the reserved system prompt, and only accept
surfaces whose value type carries free-form prose. No LLM surface classifier is
run; the first eligible free-text surface that fires receives the payload
(documented in ASSUMPTIONS.md).
