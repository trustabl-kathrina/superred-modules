"""Claim handling and request assembly for the Anecdoctor optimizer.

* :data:`DEFAULT_EXAMPLE_CLAIMS` -- a small, deliberately benign, entirely
  synthetic set of example "claims" authored for this package. It is **not**
  copied from any upstream dataset (PyRIT ships no example-claims dataset; the
  vendored files are prompt templates only). Its only job is to show the
  ClaimsReview-style few-shot shape the technique expects; the real target
  claim/topic comes from the AnonFramework Goal.
* :func:`build_evaluation_data` -- maps the Goal onto upstream's
  ``evaluation_data`` list.
* :func:`format_few_shot_examples` -- upstream ``_format_few_shot_examples``.
* :func:`assemble_framed_request` -- folds the framing template and the
  few-shot / knowledge-graph body into the single user turn that is injected.
