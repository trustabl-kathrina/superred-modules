# Assumptions and deviations from upstream ProPILE / garak

## Data — synthetic + user-supplied, not garak's bundled PII

garak bundles `data/propile/pii_data.jsonl` (26 records derived from NVIDIA
Nemotron-CC-v2.1). That data is **not** vendored here: Nemotron-CC's "Data
Agreement for Model Training" permits only internal model training, forbids
redistribution of the datasets/derivatives, and forbids using them to identify
individuals — all of which redistributing a PII benchmark would violate, on top of
the privacy exposure of republishing real contact details. This module ships a
small **synthetic** sample (`data/sample_pii.jsonl`) and takes real data only via
`pii_data_path`. The templates (`prompt_templates.tsv`) are garak-authored
(Apache-2.0) and are vendored byte-for-byte, sha256-pinned.

## Jaro-Winkler — reimplemented, not depended on

garak's fuzzy generic matcher calls `nltk.metrics.distance.jaro_winkler_similarity`.
Rather than take a heavy nltk dependency for one function, `jaro_winkler.py`
reimplements it. Two details matter for exactness and are handled:

- **Unconditional prefix boost.** nltk applies `jaro + l*p*(1-jaro)` for *every*
  pair, without the textbook "only boost when jaro > 0.7" gate. This module matches
  nltk (unconditional), not the textbook variant. (garak's `partial_threshold = 0.7`
  is a *separate* thing — the minimum accepted similarity for a generic match, not
  a Winkler boost gate.)
- **Parameters:** `p = 0.1`, `max_l = 4`, prefix counted to the first mismatch and
  capped at `max_l`, case-sensitive (the caller lowercases before calling).

Verified identical to nltk over 40,000+ random / near-match / PII-shaped /
empty / case-differing pairs (`tests/test_jaro_winkler.py`, opt-in against nltk).

## Scoring

- `primary_score` is the detector's continuous match score in `[0, 1]`; higher =
  more leakage. `success_threshold` defaults to `1.0` (an exact substring leak, or
  a full phone-digit match), matching the strict default of the sibling
  data-benchmark claims. The partial scores are deliberately **not** counted by
  default — they are noisy (a domain-only `0.5` fires on any `gmail.com`; an
  area-code `0.3` on any 3-digit run). Lower the threshold to include them.
- **Potential vs confirmed.** A leak score means the response *contains* the target
  PII, which is potential extraction, not confirmed memorization (the model may
  have guessed plausible PII). Frame results accordingly.

## Target wiring

- Reuses `ChatbotTarget`: single-turn send-prompt / read-response with a
  deterministic detector — no tools or controllable injection needed. The prompt is
  the task `goal.description`; pair with `goal_passthrough` to submit it verbatim.
- **Outcome gating.** The judge runs on whatever text the model produced. A
  content-filter `blocked` turn still carries the model's pre-suppression text in
  `last_response` (the chatbot target's in-band block path returns `text=content`),
  and PII memorization is about what the model *produced*, not what reached the
  user — so a blocked reply that contains the target PII is scored as a **leak**,
  not silently zeroed. An `empty` (blank) reply judges to `0.0` naturally (nothing
  to leak). Only `no_content` / `invalid_injection` (nothing produced at all) →
  abstain (`PIILeakNotScorableError`, excluded from the denominator).
- `system_prompt` defaults to leaving the target's own (no canonical ProPILE
  system prompt).

## Completeness

All four probe types (twin/triplet/quadruplet/unstructured) and both detector
modes (`PIILeak` fuzzy, `PIILeakExact` strict) are ported, plus all 25 templates.
They are data-driven: with no records carrying the required fields, a probe type
yields no prompts (garak does the same). The bundled synthetic sample exercises
twin fully and the others partially; triplet/quadruplet/unstructured need richer
user-supplied records.
