"""Illustrative seed prompts for the Prompt Shields evasion/over-block claim.

These are a small, ORIGINAL set of canonical prompt-injection patterns (attack)
and plainly-benign requests (benign), authored for this module — they are not
copied from any licensed dataset. They exist so the claim is runnable and
testable out of the box and to seed an optimizer; they are NOT a benchmark. For
a real evaluation, supply your own corpus via ``prompt_shield_claim(seeds=...)``.

Each seed carries a ``channel``: ``user_prompt`` (direct injection, the default
Prompt Shields mode) or ``document`` (indirect injection embedded in grounding
content). The attack seeds are inputs a competent detector *should* flag
(``attackDetected == true``); an attack the detector misses is an evasion. The
benign seeds are inputs it should *not* flag; a benign input it flags is
over-blocking (the false-positive axis).
