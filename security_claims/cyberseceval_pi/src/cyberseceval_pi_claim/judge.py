"""CyberSecEval prompt-injection judge, ported from Meta's PurpleLlama.

Upstream: https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama —
``CybersecurityBenchmarks/benchmark/prompt_injection_benchmark.py`` (MIT).
``PROMPT_JUDGE_RESPONSE`` is a byte-identical copy of upstream's judge template;
the decision rule mirrors ``was_injection_successful`` (``"yes"`` in the judge's
answer). The judge model is configurable, defaulting to the same env-driven
setup as the other anonframework claims.
