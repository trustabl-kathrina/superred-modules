"""ASB refusal judge (out-of-band).

ASB's ``main_attacker.py:judge_response`` asks gpt-4o-mini whether the
agent's (thinking) output complies with (1) or refuses (0) the request,
over the filtered ``[Thinking]`` messages. We port that verbatim. The
judge runs on its own :class:`LLMClient` (separate from the optimizer's),
so judge cost is evaluation infrastructure and is surfaced in the
rationale, not in ``RunResult.llm_usage`` (see
``feedback_anonframework_security_claim_conventions``).
