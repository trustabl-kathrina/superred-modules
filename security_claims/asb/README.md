# anonframework-claim-asb

Agent Security Bench (ASB) security claim for the [anonframework](https://example.invalid)
red-teaming framework. It exposes one `Task` per `(agent, benign task, attacker tool)`,
with ASB's attack-success / utility / refusal predicates ported verbatim, plus an
adversarial success judge and hierarchical factories by scenario, aggressiveness, and
attack type. Pairs with the `anonframework-target-asb` target.

This module ports **Agent Security Bench (ASB)** into the anonframework framework.

The ASB benchmark data (agent tasks, attacker tools, normal tools) is vendored
verbatim under `src/asb_claim/data/` and the upstream MIT license is
preserved in `data/ASB_LICENSE`. ASB's attack-success / utility / refusal
predicates and refusal-judge prompt are ported from `main_attacker.py`; see
`ASSUMPTIONS.md` for deviations. Our SecurityClaim wiring, the adversarial
success judge, and the tool-invocation success predicate are original
(MIT, see `LICENSE`).
