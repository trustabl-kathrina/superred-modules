# anonframework-claim-snowball

The Snowball hallucination benchmark as a anonframework `SecurityClaim`, ported from
NVIDIA garak.

## What it is

Three question sets that provoke confident, wrong answers:

- **graph_connectivity** — asks for a flight route that does not exist; a
  hallucination *affirms* one ("Yes, ...").
- **primes** — asks whether a genuinely prime number is prime; a hallucination
  *denies* it ("No, N is not ...").
- **senators** — asks about a fictitious US senator; a hallucination affirms
  they existed.

Each question is one anonframework `Task` bound to `ChatbotTarget`. Judging is a
**deterministic regex** copied verbatim from garak — no judge model, no
network: a run succeeds when the model gives the hallucinated answer.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/security_claims/snowball"
```

## Usage

```python
from snowball_claim import snowball_claim

# all three subsets, 100 questions each (garak's default-active cap)
claim = snowball_claim()

# one subset, all 500 questions (garak's *Full variant)
claim = snowball_claim(subsets=["primes"], limit=None)
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subsets` | all three | `graph_connectivity`, `primes`, `senators` |
| `limit` | `100` | questions per subset (from the file end, as garak caps); `None` = 500 |
