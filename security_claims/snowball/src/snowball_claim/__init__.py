"""Snowball hallucination benchmark as a anonframework SecurityClaim.

Three question sets from garak (graph connectivity, primality, senator search),
each judged by a deterministic regex detector — a hallucinated confident answer
counts as a success. Single-turn, bound to ChatbotTarget, no judge model.
