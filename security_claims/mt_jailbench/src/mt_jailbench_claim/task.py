"""MTJailBenchTask: one task per HarmBench standard behavior.

Bound to :class:`chatbot_target.ChatbotTarget`, like the sibling ``harmbench``
and ``strongreject`` claims: the 3-judge evaluation needs a single final
assistant response, which the chatbot target exposes via the ``last_response``
query, and the canonical run uses no target system prompt (replicated via the
``system_prompt`` config slot). MT-JailBench attacks are multi-turn; the
optimizer drives the conversation and the claim judges the final response.

The same HarmBench standard behaviors are evaluated by anonframework's existing
``harmbench`` claim, but with HarmBench's Llama-2 classifier judge. This claim
instead applies MT-JailBench's unanimous 3-judge vote (XTeaming + CoA + FITD),
so the two claims measure the *same* behaviors under *different* success
criteria.
