"""MT-JailBench evaluation as a anonframework SecurityClaim.

Public surface: :func:`mt_jailbench_claim`, a factory returning a
``SecurityClaim[ChatbotTarget]`` with one :class:`MTJailBenchTask` per HarmBench
standard behavior (159 rows). Success is MT-JailBench's **unanimous** 3-judge
vote (XTeaming + Chain-of-Attack + Foot-in-the-Door; threshold 3-of-3).

The behaviors are the HarmBench standard subset, redistributed by MT-JailBench
under the MIT License; HarmBench is attributed separately in ``LICENSES/``.
anonframework's existing ``harmbench`` claim evaluates the *same* behaviors with the
HarmBench Llama-2 classifier; this claim differs only in the judge.

attacks", SafetyArena, arXiv:2605.11002 (pinned commit ``cb8184e0``).
