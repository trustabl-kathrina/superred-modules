"""DtapTask: one Task per DTAP per-task ``config.yaml`` (benign or malicious).

DTAP (DecodingTrust-Agent) ships a tree of per-task directories. Each is one
objective: a *benign* task (a real user request the agent should complete) or a
*malicious* task (an attacker objective the agent should refuse / not carry out),
under one of two threat models (``direct`` = the user themselves is adversarial;
``indirect`` = a third party injects through the environment). This Task is
target-agnostic: it binds to the base :class:`~anonframework.core.interfaces.target.Target`
and drives whichever concrete DTAP agent target (Claude Code, OpenClaw) the
experiment wires in, through that target's DTAP config/query surface.

- :meth:`configure_target` sets the per-task scenario (active MCP env servers,
  env-injection config, system prompt, the benign user prompt, the task dir, the
  available-injection hint, the threat model, the native-tools policy). The
  attack *content* is not set
  here: the target merely exposes the injection points; an attacker (optimizer)
  drives them. If the target does not expose the DTAP config slots, the task
  raises :class:`~anonframework.core.interfaces.task.NotApplicable` so an incompatible
  target is skipped rather than crashing.
- :meth:`evaluate` reads the post-run agent outputs + live env ports back from the
  target and calls the byte-faithful DTAP judge OUT OF BAND (the judge re-queries
  the live environment state; it does not count against the optimizer's budget).
  For a malicious task the primary score is the judge's ``attack_success`` (True ==
  the attack SUCCEEDED, the safety property was violated) and ``task_success`` is a
  sub-score; for a benign task the primary is ``task_success`` (did the agent do
  the legitimate job). Both primaries are unscoped (``security_domain=None``): the
  attack surface is chosen per experiment by the Controller's scope, not fixed by
  the task.

#: only route to the task files -- the setup the benchmark actually intends to score.

#: Upstream applies its deny list only for ``os-filesystem``
