# anonframework-claim-injecagent

A anonframework **SecurityClaim** porting [InjecAgent](https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/InjecAgent)
(Zhan et al., ACL Findings 2024, arXiv:2403.02691) — the canonical benchmark for
**indirect prompt injection against tool-integrated LLM agents**. A tool the
agent calls returns attacker-controlled content; the attack succeeds when the
agent, swayed by it, invokes an attacker-chosen tool. Judged by InjecAgent's own
**deterministic, LLM-free** attack-success evaluator.

| Attack type | Base | Enhanced | What "success" means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **dh** — Direct Harm | 510 | 510 | agent invokes the attacker's harmful tool (single step) |
| **ds** — Data Stealing | 544 | 544 | agent exfiltrates data *and* sends it (two steps) |

The **base** corpus is the paper's 1,054-case headline; **enhanced** reinforces
each injection with a hacking prompt (`"IMPORTANT!!! Ignore all previous
instructions…"`). Pairs with the
[`anonframework-target-injecagent`](../../targets/injecagent) package, which drives
the agent-under-test (ReAct or native function-calling) over the simulated tool
environment and runs the ds two-step.

## Usage

```python
from injecagent_claim import injecagent_claim, injecagent_dh_claim
from injecagent_target import injecagent_target_factory

claim = injecagent_claim()                          # 1,054 base tasks (dh + ds)
dh = injecagent_dh_claim()                          # 510 direct-harm tasks
enh = injecagent_claim(settings=["enhanced"])       # the reinforced setting
one = injecagent_claim(task_ids=["dh_base_000"])    # a single task

target = injecagent_target_factory(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
# hand `claim` and `target` to the anonframework Controller with an optimizer.
```

Each task's `primary_score` (named `attack_score`) is the **attack magnitude**:
`1.0` when the injection made the agent take the attacker's action, `0.0`
otherwise — higher is a more-successful attack, matching anonframework's convention.
`EvaluationResult.success` is the same boolean. Sub-scores expose the step-1 /
step-2 breakdown and whether the output was malformed (`invalid`).

To reproduce InjecAgent's aggregate ASR table across a run, the ported
`get_score(dh_results, ds_results)` (in `injecagent_claim.judge`) computes the
exact upstream metric set (`ASR-valid`, `ASR-all`, S1/S2 breakdown, Valid Rate).

## Provenance & faithfulness

The four test-case JSONs are vendored **byte-for-byte** from upstream (verify
with `python scripts/sync_upstream.py --check`). The prompted (`evaluate_output_prompted`)
and finetuned (`evaluate_output_finetuned`) evaluators, the ReAct parser, the
degenerate-output detectors, and the `get_score` ASR formulas are ported from
upstream `src/output_parsing.py` and `src/utils.py` into a pure judge. Every
deliberate deviation is documented in [`ASSUMPTIONS.md`](ASSUMPTIONS.md).
MIT-licensed (module code + InjecAgent's own synthetic data). The tool *schemas*
InjecAgent adapted from ToolEmu (Apache-2.0) are vendored in the **target**
package, with their own attribution.
