"""Judge-model parameterization.

The StrongREJECT rubric judge model is overridable (e.g. to an AWS Bedrock
id when OpenAI is not reachable) while defaulting to the paper-faithful
``openai/gpt-4o-mini`` (Souly et al. 2024). These tests pin both the faithful
default and the override path through ``JudgeConfig``, the factories, and the
live ``score`` call site.
