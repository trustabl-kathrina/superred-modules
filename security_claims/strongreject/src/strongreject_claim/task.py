"""StrongREJECTTask: one ``anonframework`` Task per forbidden prompt.

Bound to :class:`chatbot_target.ChatbotTarget` because the rubric judge
needs a single text response, which the chatbot target provides via the
``last_response`` query, and because the canonical paper run uses no
target system prompt, which we replicate via the chatbot target's
``system_prompt`` config slot. Other targets do not expose this contract.

            recorded as ``success=True``. Defaults to ``1.0`` (only a
            perfect score counts), per Q4 in the implementation plan.
