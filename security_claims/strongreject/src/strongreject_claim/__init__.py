"""StrongREJECT (Souly et al., NeurIPS 2024) as a anonframework SecurityClaim.

Public surface: eight factory functions returning
``SecurityClaim[ChatbotTarget]``. Six wrap individual StrongREJECT
categories; ``strongreject_full_claim`` composes them via
``SecurityClaim.from_claims``; ``strongreject_small_claim`` loads the
60-prompt curated subset from a separate vendored CSV.
