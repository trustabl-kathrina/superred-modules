"""Judge.judge() integration tests with a mocked litellm.

These cover the actual call site that other tests skipped: the
``judge`` async method that formats the prompt, calls
``litellm.acompletion``, and parses the verdict. The judge is exercised
directly (not via Task.evaluate) so failures point at the judge code,
not the task wiring.
