"""Tests for the hardcoded-kwarg rejection in leaf and composed factories.

Before this fix, calling e.g. ``harmbench_standard_test(functional_categories=...)``
would forward ``functional_categories`` to ``harmbench_claim()`` which already
received it from the leaf factory's hardcoded value, producing a confusing
``TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument`` from the underlying
function. Now we raise a clear ``TypeError`` at the leaf with a helpful message.
