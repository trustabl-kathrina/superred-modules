# anonframework-claim-harmbench

[HarmBench](https://www.harmbench.org/) standardized red-teaming benchmark
([Mazeika et al., ICML 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04249)) packaged as
a anonframework `SecurityClaim` against `ChatbotTarget`.

## What it is

- 400 textual harmful behaviors (320 test split + 80 val split).
- Three functional categories per split: standard (159 / 41), contextual
  (81 / 19), copyright (80 / 20).
- Per-behavior binary verdict (1 = behavior elicited, 0 = refused or off-topic)
  from an LLM-as-judge using HarmBench's verbatim Llama-2 classifier prompt
  template, plus the upstream MinHash matcher for copyright behaviors.
- Headline metric: ASR = mean of per-behavior labels; reported per
  functional and semantic category via `EvaluationResult.sub_scores`.

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio, os
from chatbot_target import ChatbotTarget, USER_TAG, RESPONSE_READABLE_TAG
from harmbench_claim import harmbench_standard_val
from anonframework.core.controller import Controller, TargetFactory

api_key = os.environ["LITELLM_API_KEY"]
api_base = os.environ["LITELLM_API_BASE"]

# Fresh ChatbotTarget per task; bump concurrency for parallel evaluation
# (the chatbot wraps the LiteLLM proxy and is safe to call concurrently).
target_factory = TargetFactory(
    create=lambda: ChatbotTarget(
        model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", api_key=api_key, api_base=api_base,
    ),
    concurrency=8,
)

# 41 standard val behaviors. For all 80 val behaviors (across 3 functional
# categories) use `harmbench_val(...)`; for the 320-task test split use
# `harmbench_test(...)`; for everything use `harmbench_complete(...)`.
claim = harmbench_standard_val(
    judge_model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    judge_api_base=api_base,
    judge_api_key=api_key,
)

# Bring your own optimizer; the goal-passthrough baseline sends each behavior
# once, verbatim (pip install -e optimizers/goal_passthrough)
from goal_passthrough_optimizer import GoalPassthroughOptimizer

controller = Controller(
    optimizer_factory=GoalPassthroughOptimizer,
    target_factory=target_factory,
    security_claim=claim,
    scope=frozenset({USER_TAG, RESPONSE_READABLE_TAG}),
    max_runs_per_task=1,
    include_feedback=False,
)
result = asyncio.run(controller.run())   # -> ThreatModelResult
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e ./security_claims/harmbench   # provides the harmbench_claim package
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm      # for the copyright MinHash matcher
```

The pip-installable name is `anonframework-claim-harmbench`; the importable Python
package is `harmbench_claim`.

## Public factories

The module exposes a hierarchical set of factories so you can pick any
granularity from "one functional split of one dataset split" up to "the
whole benchmark."

All factory parameters are keyword-only (the underlying signature uses
``def harmbench_claim(*, judge_model, judge_api_base, judge_api_key,
split, functional_categories, semantic_categories, csv_path, clip_tokens)``).

```
# Parameterized base
harmbench_claim(*, judge_model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", split="test",
                functional_categories=None, semantic_categories=None, ...)

# Leaf factories — six combinations of (split, functional_category)
harmbench_standard_test()    harmbench_standard_val()
harmbench_contextual_test()  harmbench_contextual_val()
harmbench_copyright_test()   harmbench_copyright_val()

# Composed
harmbench_test()             harmbench_val()      # all 3 functional categories
harmbench_complete()                              # both splits
```

Leaf and composed factories accept the same judge / filter kwargs
(`judge_model`, `judge_api_base`, `judge_api_key`, `semantic_categories`,
`csv_path`, `clip_tokens`) but reject `split` / `functional_categories`
because those are hardcoded by the leaf — pass them to
`harmbench_claim()` directly if you need to override.

Each leaf factory returns a flat `SecurityClaim` of one Task per behavior;
the composed factories use `SecurityClaim.from_claims` lazy chaining.

## Recommended scope

`frozenset({USER_TAG, RESPONSE_READABLE_TAG})` (interactive black-box).
HarmBench's threat model assumes the attacker injects the user message
and observes the response. The claim itself does not pin a scope; the
experiment script picks the scope by passing it to the `Controller`
constructor. To sweep multiple scopes, instantiate one `Controller` per
scope and `asyncio.gather` them.

## Per-task metadata for post-run analysis

Each `HarmBenchTask` exposes plain attributes so you can aggregate
`result.task_results` (the `ThreatModelResult` returned by
`controller.run()`) by any axis:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
buckets: dict[tuple[str, str], list[bool]] = defaultdict(list)
for tr in result.task_results:
    t = tr.task
    buckets[("functional", t.functional_category)].append(tr.success)
    buckets[("semantic", t.semantic_category)].append(tr.success)
```

`EvaluationResult.sub_scores` additionally carries
`functional_<name>`, `semantic_<name>`, and `advbench_refusal_label` keys
for in-trajectory attribution.

## Deviations from upstream HarmBench

We document every deviation up front so ASR numbers are interpretable.

| Aspect | HarmBench reference | This port | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judge model | `cais/HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls` (fine-tuned, ~93% agreement with humans) | LLM-as-judge via `LLMConfig` (default in examples: `gpt-4o-mini`) using HarmBench's verbatim prompt template | The 13B classifier needs ~26 GB VRAM. Our framework runs on the litellm proxy. The HarmBench paper itself (page 7) warns that closed-source judges are "far from ideal", but the canonical Llama-2-cls prompt template still applies. |
| `max_new_tokens` on target | 512 (paper-mandated for ASR convergence; up to 30% variance otherwise) | provider default (no `max_tokens` override on `ChatbotTarget`) | Conscious user decision; ASR comparable across runs within this port but not directly comparable to the HarmBench leaderboard. |
| `temperature` on target | 0 (greedy) | 0 (already hardcoded in `ChatbotTarget.run()`) | Faithful. |
| System prompt | none added by the pipeline | task sets `system_prompt=""`; `ChatbotTarget` then suppresses the system message entirely | Faithful (verified by `TestEmptySystemPrompt`). |
| Contextual test-case rendering | `f"{ContextString}\n\n---\n\n{Behavior}"` (per `baselines/direct_request/direct_request.py:24`) | identical, in `Goal.description` via `render_test_case` | Faithful. |
| Copyright eval | MinHash + spaCy + 100 reference `.pkl` files; Jaccard > 0.6 | identical port of `compute_results_hashing` from `eval_utils.py`; spaCy 3.8 instead of 3.7 (Python 3.13 compat) | Near-faithful; tokenization may differ marginally from spaCy 3.7. |
| AdvBench refusal-prefix diagnostic | enabled via `--include_advbench_metric` (29 prefixes in `eval_utils.py`) | always enabled as `sub_scores["advbench_refusal_label"]` | Faithful (free additional metric). |
| `[/INST]` prompt-injection sanitization in judge prompt | none (upstream issue #91 is unfixed) | none | Vector is inert against chat-completions APIs (Llama-2 instruction tokens are plain text there). |
| Generation pre-judge clipping | classifier-tokenizer, 512 tokens, right-truncated | `tiktoken` (if installed) or 4-chars-per-token approximation, 512 tokens | Approximation acceptable; Jaccard threshold tolerates small differences and the chat-completions judge has 128k context anyway. |
| Unparseable or failed judgement | `compute_results_classifier` records `label=-1` and continues | retried, then raised (`JudgeUnparseableError` / `JudgeUnavailableError`); the task errors instead of being scored | A judge that never answered is not evidence the behavior was not elicited. Scoring it 0 makes a broken judge read as a robust target, and makes it permanent: an errored task is re-measured on resume, a scored one is kept. Every `EvaluationResult` this claim emits carries `sub_scores["judge_ran"] == 1.0`. |

ASR numbers from this port are **not directly comparable to the HarmBench
leaderboard.** They are useful for relative comparison across (target,
optimizer) pairs within experiments using this module.
