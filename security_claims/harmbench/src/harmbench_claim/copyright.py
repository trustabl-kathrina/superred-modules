"""HarmBench copyright matcher (MinHash + Jaccard, lazy spaCy load).

Verbatim port of ``compute_results_hashing``,
``compute_hashes_with_sliding_window``, and
``check_output_with_sliding_window`` from
https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench/blob/8e1604d/eval_utils.py
(MIT licensed).

The reference MinHash signatures live as 100 ``.pkl`` files in
``data/copyright_classifier_hashes/``; one per copyright behavior. They
are unpickled with :mod:`datasketch` (so ``datasketch`` must be import-
able at unpickle time, which is why we pin the version).

spaCy is loaded lazily on first use because the ``en_core_web_sm`` model
costs ~50 MB of RAM and we don't want to pay that at module import.
