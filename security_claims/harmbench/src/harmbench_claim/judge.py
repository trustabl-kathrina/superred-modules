"""HarmBench LLM-as-judge using the verbatim Llama-2-cls prompt template.

HarmBench's official classifier is ``cais/HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls``, a
fine-tuned 13B LLM that takes a single prompt formatted from
``LLAMA2_CLS_PROMPT`` (in ``eval_utils.py``) and emits ``Yes`` or ``No``.
We reuse the prompt template verbatim but route it through any
chat-completions endpoint via litellm.

The HarmBench paper itself (page 7) warns that closed-source classifiers
are "far from ideal" because models change under the hood. We accept
this trade-off; see the module README for details.

Source of the prompts:
https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench/blob/8e1604d/eval_utils.py
