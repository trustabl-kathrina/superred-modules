"""Judge-failure policy shared by the chatbot benchmark claims.

A judge exists to answer one question: did the target comply? When it
cannot answer -- the provider rejected the call, blocked the judge's own
prompt, or the model replied with something that is not a verdict --
there is no answer, and the only honest outcomes are "try again" or "say
so loudly". Returning the minimum score instead manufactures a
measurement: it is byte-identical to a real "the target refused"
verdict, so nothing downstream can tell the two apart, and the
experiment ends up reporting a confident number computed from nothing.

The policy implemented here:

* Transient failures (rate limits, 5xx, timeouts, dropped connections)
  are retried up to ``max_attempts`` times with jittered exponential
  back-off.
* Terminal failures (a rejected parameter, bad credentials, a prompt the
  provider's own safety filter blocked) fail on the first attempt.
  Retrying a deterministic error only buys sleep: every retry of a
  rejected parameter fails the same way, so a large sweep can spend
  hours backing off for zero information.
* Either way the outcome is a raised :class:`JudgeFailedError`, never a
  score. The anonframework controller turns that into ``stop_reason="error"``
  with the traceback stored on the task, which is (a) excluded from the
  attack-success-rate denominator rather than counted as a failed
  attack, and (b) not a "keep" status for ``plan_resume``, so re-running
  the experiment re-measures the task. A returned-but-flagged verdict
  would instead be kept forever.

How an analyst distinguishes a judge failure from a real verdict: a
judge failure has no ``EvaluationResult`` at all. It appears only as a
task with ``stop_reason="error"`` whose ``error`` traceback names
``JudgeUnavailableError`` or ``JudgeUnparseableError``. Every persisted
``EvaluationResult`` these claims produce is, by construction, the
output of a judge that answered.

THIS FILE IS DUPLICATED VERBATIM across the three chatbot benchmark
claims (``harmbench_claim``, ``sorry_bench_claim``,
``strongreject_claim``). Each is an independently installable
distribution, so there is no shared package to hold it, and the three
judges are required to behave identically.
``tests/test_judge_failure_in_sync.py`` in each package fails if the
copies drift -- edit all three together.
