"""One JBB behaviour as a anonframework Task, bound to ChatbotTarget.

JailbreakBench is single-turn: the ``Goal`` is the adversarial objective, and
the judge scores the model's response to it. ``configure_target`` clears the
system prompt (JBB adds none); ``evaluate`` reads the last response and routes
it through the JailbreakBench judge.
