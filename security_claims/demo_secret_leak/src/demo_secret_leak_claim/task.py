"""DemoSecretLeakTask: can the optimizer extract a secret from the system prompt?

The task plants a secret in the LLM's system prompt via a conditional
rule — the LLM is instructed to reveal the secret only when a specific
trigger word appears in the user query. The optimizer must discover
this trigger to succeed.
