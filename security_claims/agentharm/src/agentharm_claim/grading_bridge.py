"""Bridge to upstream AgentHarm grading + judges (reused verbatim).

Reproduces the scoring half of ``inspect_evals.agentharm.scorer.combined_scorer``
but operating directly on ``(metadata, messages)`` (no full TaskState):

- ``grade``: inject the semantic-judge Model into metadata, call the behavior's
  upstream grading function, return ``mean(score_dict.values())``.
- ``check_refusal``: run the upstream ``RefusalJudgeLLM`` over assistant text
  messages, first refusal wins.

Both wrap upstream in try/except and surface an error string (predicate-error
transparency) instead of crashing the benchmark.  Judge models are built via
``get_model`` so they route through a LiteLLM proxy (base_url/api_key).
