"""Combined chatbot safety SecurityClaim for anonframework.

Unions the chatbot harmful-instruction benchmarks (HarmBench, SORRY-Bench,
StrongREJECT) into one strong overall claim, removing exact AND semantic
duplicate harmful behaviours (the same intent worded differently across
benchmarks). The semantic selection is pre-computed and committed, so the claim
builds deterministically with no embedding at runtime.

- :func:`chatbot_suite_claim` -- the headline factory; call it with a target id
  and judge credentials to get the canonical 79-task claim.
- :func:`combine_claims` -- the generic, benchmark-agnostic combinator.
