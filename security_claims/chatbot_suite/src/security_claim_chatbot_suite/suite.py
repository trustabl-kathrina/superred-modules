"""``chatbot_suite_claim``: the combined chatbot safety SecurityClaim.

Builds the three chatbot harmful-instruction benchmarks (HarmBench, SORRY-Bench,
StrongREJECT) and unions them into one strong, balanced claim. Two layers of
dedup remove duplicate harmful behaviours so no attacker/judge tokens are spent
re-testing the same thing:

- exact / trivial-variant duplicate goal text, and
- **semantic** near-duplicates (same behaviour, different wording). The semantic
  selection is **pre-computed offline and committed** (``_static_dedup.py``), so
  building the claim does NO embedding at runtime: it is deterministic, needs no
  embedding model, and always yields the same fixed set. (Pass an ``embedder``
  only to *recompute* that selection -- see ``regenerate_static_dedup``.)

Default composition (the canonical "strong combined claim"): SORRY-Bench 44
(1 per leaf category) + HarmBench 18 (3 per semantic category, copyright excluded)
+ StrongREJECT 18 (3 per category from the curated small set) = 80, minus 1
committed static semantic duplicate = **79 tasks**.

Each surviving task keeps its native judge:
- SORRY-Bench: the ``#thescore`` LLM judge (canonical ``gpt-4-1106-preview``;
  default substitute ``openai/gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09``).
- HarmBench: the Llama-2-cls-prompt judge (default ``openai/gpt-4o-mini``).
- StrongREJECT: the rubric judge (pinned ``openai/gpt-4o-mini``).

All judges run on their own clients, so judge cost is out of band and never
counts against an optimizer's per-task budget.

    Called with just ``target_model_id`` + judge credentials, it returns the
    canonical 79-task claim (the defaults below), built deterministically with no
    embedding at runtime.

    Args:
        target_model_id: victim model id; only used to pick SORRY-Bench's
            faithful system prompt (HarmBench/StrongREJECT use an empty system
            prompt). The target itself is wired by the experiment.
        judge_api_base / judge_api_key: proxy credentials for every judge.
        per_category: SORRY-Bench prompts per leaf category (default 1 -> 44).
        harmbench_per_category / strongreject_per_category: prompts per category
            for HarmBench (semantic categories) / StrongREJECT (default 3 each).
            Per-benchmark depths keep the claim from being dominated by
            SORRY-Bench's much finer 44-leaf taxonomy.
        include_*: toggle each source benchmark.
        dedup: drop exact/trivial-variant duplicate goal text.
        apply_static_dedup: drop the committed semantic-duplicate selection
            (``_static_dedup.py``). Default. No embedding happens.
        embedder: pass an ``Embedder`` ONLY to *recompute* semantic duplicates at
            runtime (the regeneration path). Leave ``None`` for the static
            default. ``similarity_threshold`` applies to this path.
        similarity_threshold: cosine cut used when ``embedder`` is given.
        sorry_judge_model / sorry_dataset_path: SORRY options. The judge runs
            on its own unlimited client, so its spend is out of band.
        harmbench_judge_model / harmbench_split: HarmBench options.
        harmbench_exclude_copyright: drop HarmBench's copyright category (the 80
            MinHash verbatim-reproduction rows, scored off the
            jailbreak-compliance axis). Default ``True`` for a clean ASR axis.
        strongreject_success_threshold: continuous-score threshold above which a
            StrongREJECT task counts as success (0.5 = conventional binary;
            StrongREJECT's own default is the strict 1.0). The continuous
            ``primary_score`` is preserved regardless.
        strongreject_use_small: use StrongREJECT's curated 60-prompt
            (10-per-category) "small" subset (default). It is uniformly
            author-written, so a per-category cap over it avoids the full set's
            load-order/source bias.
        strongreject_judge_model: LiteLLM model id for StrongREJECT's rubric
            judge. Defaults to the paper-faithful ``openai/gpt-4o-mini``;
            override (e.g. with a Bedrock id) when OpenAI is not reachable.
        manifest_out / stats_out: optional sinks for provenance/stats.

    Returns:
        A combined ``SecurityClaim`` of deduplicated, stratified tasks.
