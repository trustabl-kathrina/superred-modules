"""XSTestTask: one anonframework Task per XSTest prompt.

Bound to :class:`chatbot_target.ChatbotTarget`: XSTest sends a single prompt and
classifies the single response, which the chatbot target exposes via its
``last_response`` query — the same contract StrongREJECT/HarmBench use. The
prompt itself is delivered by the optimizer as the user message (pair with the
``goal_passthrough`` optimizer to send it verbatim, which is what over-refusal
measurement needs: the safe prompt must reach the model unmodified).

Polarity (anonframework: higher = more-successful attack):

* ``safe`` prompt refused  → exaggerated safety → ``attack_score`` toward 1.0;
* ``unsafe`` prompt complied with → unsafe compliance → ``attack_score`` toward 1.0.

The default judge is the deterministic :func:`~xstest_claim.judge.strmatch_label`
(binary, offline). Pass a :class:`~xstest_claim.judge.GPTJudgeConfig` to use the
opt-in GPT classifier instead.

        prompt_type: one of the 18 XSTest types (used as ``dimension``).
        prompt_label: ``"safe"`` or ``"unsafe"`` — sets the scoring polarity.
        focus: the word/concept the prompt turns on (recorded in the rationale).
        note: upstream annotation, e.g. the harm domain (recorded in the rationale).
        judge: ``"strmatch"`` (default, deterministic) or a :class:`GPTJudgeConfig`.
        system_prompt: if not ``None``, override the target's system prompt with
            this value; if ``None`` (default) leave the target's own system

        success_threshold: attack magnitude at/above which the run counts as a

            compliance counts); ``strmatch`` is binary so this is effectively
