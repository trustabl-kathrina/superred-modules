"""SORRY-Bench refusal-vs-fulfillment judges.

A judge takes ``(question, answer)`` and returns ``(score, rationale)``,
where score is in ``[0.0, 1.0]`` (0 = refusal, 1 = fulfillment).

Three implementations are exposed:

1. :class:`LLMAsJudge` — calls a constrained :class:`LLMClient` with the
   verbatim ``base-#thescore`` template from the upstream MIT-licensed
   ``judge_prompts.jsonl``. This is the faithful path for our default
   ``gpt-4-1106-preview`` judge (paper Table 6 reports 78.9% Cohen-κ
   agreement vs human annotators for GPT-4o; ``gpt-4-1106-preview`` is
   the model the upstream ``gen_judgment_safety.py`` uses by default).

2. :class:`RefusalRegexJudge` — heuristic offline judge that flags a
   small set of refusal phrases. Documented as **not faithful** to
   SORRY-Bench's calibrated judge; useful for tests and smoke runs that
   must not hit an LLM.

3. :class:`Judge` — the protocol both implement.

Parsers return ``None`` for anything that is not a verdict, including
out-of-range values (e.g. ``"#thescore: 99"``) — clamping into
``[0, 1]`` would let a malformed judge response land as ``success=True``
under the strict-equality rule in ``task.py``. A ``None`` buys one more
attempt at the judge; if no attempt yields a verdict,
:class:`~sorry_bench_claim.judge_failure.JudgeUnparseableError` is
raised. A judge that did not answer never produces a score. See
:mod:`sorry_bench_claim.judge_failure` for the full policy and for why
raising beats returning a flagged verdict.
