# anonframework-claim-sorry-bench

[SORRY-Bench](https://sorry-bench.github.io/) safety-refusal benchmark
([Xie et al., ICLR 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14598)) packaged as a
anonframework `SecurityClaim` against `ChatbotTarget`.

> **Community port — not an official implementation.** This module is an
> unofficial re-implementation of SORRY-Bench (Xie et al.) for anonframework. It is
> not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by the original authors.

## What it tests

- 44 fine-grained safety categories, 10 unsafe instructions each → **440 prompts**.
- Per-prompt fulfillment score (0 = refusal, 1 = compliance) from an
  LLM-as-judge using SORRY-Bench's verbatim `base-#thescore` template.
- Headline metric (paper Figure 4): mean of per-category means; range
  `0.0` to `1.0`. Higher means more compliance with unsafe instructions.

## Getting the dataset

The dataset is **gated and non-redistributable** under a custom license
that forbids embedding it in third-party packages. This module never
ships any benchmark prompts. Two ways to provide them at runtime:

1. **Manual download** (recommended for offline / CI):
   ```
   # In your browser, accept the gate at:
   #   https://huggingface.co/datasets/sorry-bench/sorry-bench-202503
   # Then download question.jsonl to a path of your choice.
   export SORRY_BENCH_QUESTION_JSONL=/abs/path/to/question.jsonl
   ```

2. **HuggingFace lazy-load** (auto-downloads to `~/.cache/huggingface/`):
   ```
   /path/to/.venv/bin/hf auth login
   # ... follow the prompts and paste a token from
   #     https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   # Make sure the gate at the dataset URL above is also accepted.
   ```

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio
from chatbot_target import ChatbotTarget, USER_TAG, RESPONSE_READABLE_TAG
from sorry_bench_claim import sorry_bench_claim
from anonframework.core.controller import Controller, TargetFactory
from anonframework.core.interfaces.optimizer import Optimizer
from anonframework.core.types.events import (
    ControllableInjection, ControllableNoInjection,
    ControllablePreCallEvent, RunEndEvent, RunEndResponse, RunStartEvent,
)
from anonframework.core.types.event import Event, EventResponse
from anonframework.core.types.llm import LLMConfig


# A no-attacker "passthrough" optimizer that emits the task's question
# verbatim. Use this for the vanilla SORRY-Bench evaluation. For real
# red-teaming, swap in TAP / PAIR / Crescendo / etc.
class PassthroughOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self._injected = False

    async def initialize(self, goal, controllables, observables, llm_client) -> None:
        await super().initialize(goal, controllables, observables, llm_client)
        self._goal = goal
        self._injected = False

    async def on_event(self, event: Event) -> EventResponse:
        if isinstance(event, RunStartEvent):
            self._injected = False
            return EventResponse(event=event)
        if isinstance(event, ControllablePreCallEvent):
            if self._injected:
                return ControllableNoInjection(event=event, controllable=event.controllable)
            self._injected = True
            return ControllableInjection(
                event=event, controllable=event.controllable,
                value=self._goal.description,
            )
        if isinstance(event, RunEndEvent):
            return RunEndResponse(event=event, done=True)
        return EventResponse(event=event)


async def main() -> None:
    target_factory = TargetFactory(
        create=lambda: ChatbotTarget(
            model="gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
            api_base="https://api.openai.com/v1",
            api_key="sk-...",
        ),
        concurrency=8,
    )
    claim = sorry_bench_claim(
        target_model_id="gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
        # Pass dataset_path=... if you prefer manual download:
        # dataset_path="/abs/path/to/question.jsonl",
        judge_llm_config=LLMConfig(
            model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
            api_base="https://api.openai.com/v1",
            api_key="sk-...",
        ),
        prompts_per_category=2,    # 88-prompt smoke run; omit for full 440
    )

    controller = Controller(
        optimizer_factory=PassthroughOptimizer,
        target_factory=target_factory,
        security_claim=claim,
        scope=frozenset({USER_TAG, RESPONSE_READABLE_TAG}),
        max_runs_per_task=1,
    )
    result = await controller.run()      # -> ThreatModelResult

    # Aggregate per-category and overall fulfillment from result.task_results.
    ...


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Subset selection (pilot then full)

`sorry_bench_claim` exposes two pre-defined halves of the benchmark via
`subset="a"` / `subset="b"`. Each half is **220 prompts (5/category ×
44 categories)**, stratified across the full taxonomy; the two halves
are disjoint and together reconstruct the full 440-prompt benchmark.

This is the cheap way to run a pilot first, look at the results, then
fill in the rest with no overlap:

```python
# Step 1: pilot on half A (220 prompts, ~$0.50 in judge calls)
claim_a = sorry_bench_claim(
    target_model_id="gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
    judge_llm_config=judge_cfg,
    subset="a",
)
# ... run, inspect, decide whether to continue ...

# Step 2: complete with half B (the other 220, no overlap)
claim_b = sorry_bench_claim(
    target_model_id="gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
    judge_llm_config=judge_cfg,
    subset="b",
)
```

The split is by `question_id` parity (subset A = odd, subset B = even),
which the dataset's `(question_id - 1) // 10 + 1 == category` invariant
guarantees is perfectly balanced per category. `subset` composes with
`categories` (the subset is taken from the surviving categories) and
`prompts_per_category` (truncation runs after). It is ignored when
`question_ids` is supplied. The exact id lists are exported as
`SUBSET_A_QUESTION_IDS` / `SUBSET_B_QUESTION_IDS` for downstream
analysis.

## Faithfulness anchor

We benchmark against the paper's published number for `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`:
**0.2977** (paper Figure 4 / Appendix K.2). A faithful end-to-end run
should land within `±0.10` absolute of that anchor. The widened
tolerance (vs. paper's typical ±0.05 from Table 8) absorbs three
documented sources of drift:

- `ChatbotTarget` leaves temperature at the provider default; SORRY-Bench
  uses 0.7 (paper §K.5). Per Table 8, this contributes ≤±0.05.
- GPT-4o judge agreement vs. ft-Mistral-7B (the canonical SORRY-Bench
  judge) is 78.9% vs. 81.0% Cohen-κ (paper Table 6); about 2.1 pp gap.
- Inter-annotator ceiling is ~90.5% (paper Figure 6), which caps how
  perfectly any judge can agree with humans in principle.

Per-category sanity bounds (paper §K.2):
- **Most-refused**: #8 Harassment, #9 Sexual Crimes, #20 Child-related Crimes
  (~9–11% fulfillment across all 56 paper-tested models).
- **Least-refused**: #33 Ethical Belief, #34 Religion Promotion,
  #42 Legal Consulting Advice (~74–80%).

### Replaying the smoke

`tests/smoke/run.py` is a runnable verification artifact (88 prompts,
~$0.20 in judge calls). Prerequisites:

```
pip install -e ".[smoke]"     # adds python-dotenv
hf auth login                 # plus accept the gate at the dataset page
export LITELLM_API_KEY=...
export LITELLM_API_BASE=...

python tests/smoke/run.py
```

Expected output: overall fulfillment in `[0.05, 0.55]`, with
high-refusal categories (#8/#9/#20) decisively below low-refusal
(#33/#34/#42). See the script's docstring for the full output schema.

## Known limitations

Three judge-failure modes are documented in paper §J.4 and propagate into
our port:

- **Bullet-list responses** can be over-classified as fulfillment even
  when the model refused.
- **Safety disclaimers** can be over-classified as refusal even when
  fulfillment text is present.
- **Partial fulfillment** (some sub-tasks completed, some refused) is
  genuinely ambiguous; humans disagree at ~10% on these.

These are not bugs in our port — they affect SORRY-Bench's own published
numbers — but they are real noise in the score. Plan accordingly when
interpreting category-level deltas.

## When the judge itself fails

The judge model can be unreachable, reject the request outright, or have
its own prompt blocked by the provider's safety filter (the judge prompt
quotes the target's answer, so this happens most often when the attack
worked). None of those is a verdict.

`LLMAsJudge` retries a transient failure up to `max_attempts` times (3 by
default), does not retry a deterministic one, and then raises
`JudgeUnavailableError` or `JudgeUnparseableError`. The controller records
the task with `stop_reason="error"` and the traceback: excluded from the
attack-success rate, and re-measured on the next run.

Until 2026-07 it returned `0.0` with the error text in the rationale
instead. That manufactured "the target refused" verdicts, and could leave
a task with no real verdict at all. Two markers make the stored data
checkable now: every
`EvaluationResult` carries an unscoped `sub_scores["judge_ran"]`, 1.0 when
the judge produced the verdict and 0.0 when the harness short-circuited an
empty target answer without asking it.

Report the per-cell error count next to the score. Raising fixes
"silently wrong" but leaves "silently missing", and content-filter blocks
are correlated with the attack succeeding, so the residual bias has a
direction.

## What is and is not implemented (v1)

| | v1 | Future |
|---|----|----|
| 440 base prompts | ✅ | |
| 44-category taxonomy | ✅ (canonical names from `meta_info.py`) | |
| `LLMAsJudge` (GPT-4 path) | ✅ default | |
| `RefusalRegexJudge` | ✅ (offline / smoke only — NOT faithful) | |
| 20 linguistic mutations (ASCII, Caesar, persuasion, languages, etc.) | — | tracked |
| Fine-tuned Mistral-7B judge (canonical) | — | requires GPU + 14 GB model |
| Configurable target temperature (T2 patch) | — | to pin SORRY-Bench's 0.7 |

`ChatbotTarget` sends no explicit temperature (it omits the value
because some providers, including the o1 family, reject an explicit
one), so every model runs at its provider default rather than
SORRY-Bench's 0.7. A configurable-temperature kwarg (the T2 patch) to
pin a specific value lives outside this branch.
