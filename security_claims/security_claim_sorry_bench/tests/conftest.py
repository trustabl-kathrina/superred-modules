"""Shared fixtures for the sorry_bench_claim test suite.

No synthetic test fixture is shipped; tests use the real gated
``question.jsonl`` from HuggingFace. The ``question_jsonl_path`` fixture
resolves the dataset via:

1. ``$SORRY_BENCH_QUESTION_JSONL`` env var (an absolute path the user
   has downloaded), then
2. HuggingFace lazy-load via ``hf_hub_download`` (relies on the user
   having accepted the gate and authenticated via ``hf auth login`` or
   ``HF_TOKEN``), then
3. ``pytest.fail`` with an actionable error.

The dataset never gets bundled. CI must configure either the env var or
``HF_TOKEN`` to run our tests.
