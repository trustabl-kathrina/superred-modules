# anonframework-target-crewai-agent

A [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) crew as a anonframework target — so
red-team claims and optimizers can drive a real CrewAI multi-agent crew.

The target exposes the crew's real attack surfaces as controllables, so an
optimizer's surface classifier can choose where to inject:

- `user_input` — the task input, injected via `kickoff(inputs=...)` (direct prompt
  injection);
- `tool_output` — attacker content appended to every tool's return value, i.e. the
  content a tool hands back that the agent then reads (indirect prompt injection
  via tool results — the classic agent vector);
- `system_prompt` — attacker text appended to the agent's `backstory`, which CrewAI
  substitutes into the agent's system prompt.

The target runs the crew and captures its final output and the tools its agent
called. The tool-call signal is the security surface: an injection that makes the
agent call a sensitive tool it should not is the failure a paired claim scores.
The `tool_output` / `system_prompt` surfaces are wired through the crew factory via
an `InjectionSpec` (built per run) — see `injection.py` and `build_demo_crew` for
the reference wiring a caller's own factory should follow.

## What it adds, and what the offline test proves

The value is **realism/breadth**: it exercises the real CrewAI runtime — the crew
kickoff loop and tool execution — the way a widely-used multi-agent framework
actually behaves, so agentic red-team claims can measure it directly.

Offline tests inject a scripted `BaseLLM` (`ScriptedReactLLM`) that replays
pre-scripted ReAct turns (`Action: <tool>` / `Final Answer: ...`), so a real
`crewai.Crew` runs with no network — CrewAI parses the protocol and executes tools
for real. Be precise about what that verifies: it proves the **plumbing** (input
delivery, tool-call capture, result mapping), not the security outcome — whether
the agent *follows* an injection is decided by a real model, which a live run
supplies.

A scripted llm is **stateful** (it steps through its script per call), so the
target rewinds it at the start of each run. That per-instance counter is not
concurrency-safe: run a scripted llm with `concurrency=1`. Real models are
stateless per call, so live runs have no such constraint.

## Usage

```python
from crewai_agent_target import crewai_agent_target_factory, build_demo_crew
from crewai import LLM

factory = crewai_agent_target_factory(
    crew_factory=build_demo_crew,     # (llm, injection_spec) -> crewai.Crew
    llm=LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini"),     # required: a crewai.LLM or a BaseLLM
)
```

`crew_factory` is a callable `(llm, injection_spec) -> crewai.Crew`: it receives the
`llm` **and** the run's `InjectionSpec`, and returns a fresh `crewai.Crew` whose
task description templates `{user_input}` (the attacker-controlled input the target
fills at kickoff). It owns the agent and tools, and it must wire the spec so the
attack surfaces are live — feed the agent's backstory through
`injection_spec.apply_backstory(...)` and its tools through
`injection_spec.wrap_tools(...)` (CrewAI bakes both into the Agent at build time). A
factory that ignores the spec silently disables the `system_prompt` / `tool_output`
surfaces, and a one-argument factory raises `TypeError` at run time; see
`build_demo_crew` for the reference wiring. `llm` is **required** — a CrewAI agent
cannot run without one. The target holds **no API key**: the model's auth lives on
the `llm` you supply, and only its model id / class name is ever emitted as an
observable (never the `llm` object), so no secret passes through this target.
Config: `user_task` (benign default input). Controllables: `user_input`,
`tool_output`, `system_prompt`.

## Queries

`last_response` (the crew's final output), `tool_calls` (JSON of `{name,
arguments}`), `called_tool_names` (comma-separated, in order), `error`. Tool calls
are captured via the crew's `step_callback` (which fires per agent action during
kickoff), so calls made before a mid-run error are salvaged; run errors are
recorded in `error` (never raised), so a claim can abstain.
