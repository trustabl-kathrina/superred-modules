"""Attacker-controlled injection surfaces for the CrewAI agent target.

A anonframework agent target must expose the agent's real attack surfaces, not just
the user prompt. Besides ``user_input`` (the direct task input), a CrewAI agent is
attackable through:

- **tool returns** — content a tool hands back that the agent then reads and acts
  on (indirect prompt injection: the classic agent vector), and
- **its system prompt** — instructions an attacker manages to plant in the agent's
  own system message. CrewAI composes that system message from the agent's
  ``role`` / ``goal`` / ``backstory`` (string-substituted into the prompt
  template), so ``backstory`` is the free-text field an attacker's text rides in
  on.

CrewAI bakes the backstory and tools into the ``Agent`` at build time, so the
target builds the crew *per run* and hands the factory an :class:`InjectionSpec`
carrying the current run's injected values: the factory appends the suffix to the
agent's backstory via :meth:`InjectionSpec.apply_backstory` and wraps its tools via
:meth:`InjectionSpec.wrap_tools` so every tool's return value gets the appendix
appended. An optimizer's surface classifier then chooses which named surface to
drive; left un-injected, the spec is empty and the crew runs unchanged.

``crewai`` is imported lazily (only inside :func:`_injected_tool_cls`) so this
module — and hence ``crewai_agent_target.target`` — imports with the framework
absent.

    CrewAI turns a tool's return value into the observation the agent reads by
    running it through ``format_output_for_agent`` and then ``str(...)``: for a tool
    with no ``result_schema`` that is simply ``str(result)``, and for one *with* a
    ``result_schema`` it is ``schema.model_validate(result).model_dump_json()``,
    falling back to ``str(result)`` when validation fails. A string never validates
    as a structured schema, so returning a **string** for every non-string shape
    guarantees the appendix survives into the observation in both cases — and never
    silently drops it (the false negative that would defeat this surface). We
    therefore enumerate the shapes a CrewAI tool can return rather than injecting
    only into ``str`` results:

    - ``str`` — the common case: append the text.
    - ``bytes`` / ``bytearray`` — decode (utf-8, replacing errors) then append.
    - a pydantic ``BaseModel`` (structured output) — render via ``model_dump_json``
      then append, so the payload lands after valid JSON.
    - anything else (``dict``, ``list``, scalars, ``None``, a custom object) — the
      model-visible form is ``str(result)``, so render and append.

    A coroutine (an async tool's un-awaited return) is passed through untouched;
    :class:`_InjectedTool.run` resolves it first and injects into the concrete
