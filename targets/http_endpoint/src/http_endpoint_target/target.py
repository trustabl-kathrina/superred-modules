"""HttpEndpointTarget: an arbitrary HTTP LLM/chat endpoint as a anonframework Target.

Points anonframework at *your own deployed* LLM application (or any HTTP API): the
attacker controls the values placed into a configurable JSON request body, the
target POSTs it to your endpoint, and extracts the model's reply via a
configurable JSON path. This is the "bring your own endpoint" target archetype —
distinct from provider-SDK targets (e.g. ``minimal_llm_chat``) — so any chatbot
claim / optimizer can drive a real HTTP service under test.

Values are placed JSON-safely: the configured ``body_template`` is a parsed JSON
structure, and every value equal to a placeholder such as ``{{prompt}}`` is
replaced by that slot's value *as a value* (not string-substituted), so a value
containing quotes or braces can never corrupt the request body.

Security domains are declared by the caller, because only the caller knows what
each part of the request carries. Every ``{{name}}`` placeholder is a
:class:`Slot` naming the security domain its value arrives through (the user's
message, a retrieved document, a system prompt, ...), and each slot becomes one
controllable at that domain; ``slots`` is therefore required whenever a
``body_template`` is given. The extracted reply and the endpoint's identity are
observables at ``response_domain`` and ``endpoint_domain``. The defaults model a
plain chat endpoint: one ``{{prompt}}`` slot on an independent ``user_input``
root, with the reply and the endpoint identity as leaves of a ``system`` root
(see ``README.md``).

Auth headers (an API key / bearer token) are held privately and never emitted as
an observable, returned from a query, or written into any rationale.

Live runs hit your real endpoint; offline tests inject an ``httpx.MockTransport``.
Only red-team an endpoint you are authorized to test.

        headers: request headers, may include an auth key/token — held privately,

            (compression is refused for bomb-safety — see ``max_response_bytes``), so
            any ``Accept-Encoding`` given here is ignored.
        body_template: the JSON request body as a Python structure; every value
            equal to a declared slot's ``{{name}}`` is replaced by that slot's value.
            Defaults to ``{"prompt": "{{prompt}}"}``.
        slots: ``{name: Slot(domain, default)}`` for every placeholder in
            ``body_template``, in the order their controllables are offered. Each
            becomes a controllable named ``name`` at ``domain``. **Required

            as user input; with the default template it defaults to one ``prompt``
            slot at :data:`USER_INPUT_TAG`. Construction raises ``ValueError`` if a
            declared slot's placeholder is missing from the template, or the
            template holds a placeholder no slot declares.
        response_path: dot path to the reply text in the JSON response (e.g.
            ``choices.0.message.content``); empty returns the whole body as text.
        response_domain: security domain of the ``endpoint_response`` observable
            (the extracted reply). Default :data:`RESPONSE_TAG`.
        endpoint_domain: security domain of the static ``endpoint`` observable
            (method + host). Default :data:`ENDPOINT_TAG`.
        timeout: httpx per-operation timeout (connect/read/write/pool, seconds).
            This bounds the wait *between* chunks, NOT total response time — see
            ``max_response_time`` for the total bound.
        transport: optional ``httpx`` transport for offline tests
            (``httpx.MockTransport``); ``None`` uses the real network.
        max_attempts: total number of HTTP attempts per call *including the first*
            (not retries beyond it) — ``max_attempts=3`` calls the endpoint up to
            three times, retrying only transient ``429`` / ``5xx`` / transport
            failures. Floored at 1 (always at least one attempt). Default 3.
        retry_backoff_base: base seconds for exponential backoff between attempts
            (delay = ``base * 2 ** (attempt - 1)``). Default 0.5.
        max_retry_delay: hard cap (seconds) on any backoff sleep, including a
            server-supplied ``Retry-After`` — so an untrusted endpoint cannot stall
            the run with a huge ``Retry-After``. Default 60.
        max_response_time: total wall-clock cap (seconds) per attempt on the whole
            request + body read. Unlike ``timeout`` (per-op), this bounds a hostile
            server that trickles bytes slowly to keep the connection open; on
            exceed the attempt aborts (``TimeoutError``, not retried). Default 60.
        max_response_bytes: cap on the response bytes read into memory. The body is
            streamed and the read aborts past this cap (``ResponseTooLargeError``,
            not retried); responses are requested uncompressed
            (``Accept-Encoding: identity``) and a compressed response is refused
            rather than decompressed, so an untrusted endpoint cannot exhaust memory
            with a huge or compression-bomb response (see :meth:`_request_capped`).
