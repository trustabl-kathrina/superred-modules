"""ChatbotTarget: any LLM as a chatbot (single-turn or multi-turn).

Wraps a litellm-accessible LLM for chatbot interaction.  The target
loops over controllable events so the optimizer controls conversation
length: inject a message to continue, respond with ControllableNoInjection
to end the run.  This supports single-turn (one injection then stop) and
multi-turn (multiple injections) from the same target implementation.

Security domain is a two-tree forest::

    Tree 1:  system
               ├── system_prompt              (controllable - override prompt)
               │     └── system_prompt_readable  (observable - read prompt)
               ├── model                      (controllable - modify LLM response)
               │     └── response_readable    (observable - read response)
               └── model_identity             (observable - read which model is in use)
    Tree 2:  user

Scope semantics:
    {response_readable}             -> can observe responses (read-only)
    {model}                         -> can modify LLM responses AND observe them
    {system_prompt_readable}        -> can see the system prompt text, can't change it
    {system_prompt}                 -> can see AND override the system prompt
    {system_prompt, user}           -> can override prompt + send messages
    {system_prompt_readable, user}  -> can see prompt + send messages (but not override)
    {model_identity}                -> can read which model is in use; nothing else
    {model_identity, user}          -> knows the victim model + can send messages
    {user}                          -> blind input (can send messages, see responses
                                      via ControllablePostCallEvent)
    {model, user}                   -> can modify responses + send messages

The ``model_identity`` tag isolates "knowledge of the victim model" from the
other system-tree capabilities. Earlier versions placed the ``model``
observable at ``SYSTEM_TAG`` (the root), which made model-fingerprint knowledge
inseparable from full system control. With ``model_identity`` as a sibling of
``system_prompt`` and ``model``, an attacker can be modeled as "knows which
model is being attacked" without simultaneously having system prompt override
or response modification capabilities.

Turn outcomes: a measurement must never be silently wrong
---------------------------------------------------------
Every victim turn ends in exactly one of five recorded outcomes.  The two
dispositions this target must never take are the ones that corrupt the
measurement: raising (which makes the framework abandon the whole task with
``stop_reason="error"``, discarding every completed turn with it) and silently
substituting the empty string (which the claims score as a legitimate 0.0
attacker failure).

======================  ==========================================  ====================
outcome                 what happened                               task disposition
======================  ==========================================  ====================
``ok``                  the victim replied with text                scored
``empty``               the victim replied, with a blank string     scored, flagged
``blocked``             a provider content filter suppressed it     scored: a defense
                                                                    worked, the attack
                                                                    failed
``no_content``          the provider returned no content field at   scored, flagged: NOT
                        all, after bounded retries                  a valid measurement
``invalid_injection``   the attacker's injected value was not a     no provider call;
                        usable message (``None`` / non-str /        the turn never
                        blank), so nothing was sent                 happened
======================  ==========================================  ====================

Anything else -- a transient provider failure that survives bounded retries, or
a persistent one (auth, context window, malformed request) -- still propagates
and still errors the task, because those genuinely are infrastructure failures
and must stay loud.

Each abnormal outcome leaves a dedicated ``ObservableEvent`` in the run's stored
trajectory (:data:`BLOCKED_OBSERVABLE_NAME`, :data:`EMPTY_OBSERVABLE_NAME`,
:data:`MISSING_OBSERVABLE_NAME`, :data:`RETRY_OBSERVABLE_NAME`,
:data:`INVALID_INJECTION_OBSERVABLE_NAME`) plus an entry in the
``turn_outcomes`` query, so an analyst can tell them apart afterwards.  They are
deliberately NOT distinguishable from ``last_response`` alone: all four abnormal
outcomes leave it empty.

The target never fabricates victim content
------------------------------------------
``last_response``, the ``ControllablePostCallEvent`` answer and the wire
conversation carry only text the victim actually produced (or text an attacker
holding ``model`` explicitly injected, which is a modelled capability).  A turn
with no victim text appends NOTHING to the wire conversation: no marker, no
empty assistant turn.  The attacker's next message then becomes a consecutive
user turn, which providers accept, whereas an empty assistant turn is silently
deleted by litellm (merging the neighbouring user turns) or rejected outright as
an assistant prefill.
