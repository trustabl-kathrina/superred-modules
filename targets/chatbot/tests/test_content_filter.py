"""A provider content-filter block is a scored attack failure, never an error.

When a guardrail suppresses the victim's reply the attacker did not extract
harmful content, so the run must finish and be scored.  If the exception
escaped ``run()`` the framework would abandon the task with
``stop_reason="error"`` and the attempt would be discarded, systematically
under-counting exactly the cases where a defense worked.

The blocked turn must also stay identifiable afterwards, so these tests pin the
traces it leaves: the ``response_blocked`` observable carrying the provider's
reason, the ``blocked`` turn outcome, and the ``blocked_turns`` /
``last_block_reason`` queries.

What they equally pin is that none of that is achieved by inventing a reply.
The victim produced no text, so ``last_response``, the post-call answer and the
wire conversation carry no text: a stand-in sentence would be scored by the
judge, read by the attacker and shown back to the victim as its own words.
