"""Tests for the per-server authorization tool trees (``tool_trees.py`` + data).

Covers: the data file's structural integrity across all 24 servers, the built
tag subtree (single-parent, identity-stable, correct parent links), the
tool->node resolution + root fallback, and the scope semantics the split exists
for (an ancestor node grants its descendants; a sibling does not; the server root
grants the whole subtree).
