"""Host-side MCP proxy fronting the env MCP servers: the observe/control seam.

This is the concrete :class:`~dtap_scaffold.protocols.MCPProxy`. The agent runs in
its container and is pointed at this proxy's URL for every environment tool. The
proxy sits between the agent and the real (containerised) MCP servers so the
anonframework Controller can:

1. **edit tool descriptions** before the agent ever sees them -- the DTAP *tool*
   vector. Edits come from the PreCall ``tool_description_*`` controllables and are
   applied in :meth:`list_tools` (override replaces, suffix appends), byte-for-byte
   as upstream ``MCPProxyServer._apply_injection`` does it.
2. **observe and tamper with every tool RETURN** -- the anonframework content surface
   and DTAP's indirect-injection chokepoint. :meth:`handle_tool_call` forwards the
   call to the genuine backend, fires a single ``env_tool`` PostCall
   :class:`~anonframework.core.types.events.ControllablePostCallEvent` (scoped to the
   tool's authorization node -- see :mod:`dtap_scaffold.tool_trees`) carrying the
   genuine return, and -- if the optimizer answers with a
   :class:`~anonframework.core.types.events.ControllableInjection` -- returns the
   attacker's value to the agent instead (return tampering). It emits nothing else:
   the PostCall event IS the single recorded emission for env tools (emit-once).

The HTTP/JSON-RPC plumbing in :meth:`start` (an ``aiohttp`` app the container
reaches via ``host.docker.internal``) is a thin shell that delegates to the two
core methods above. Those core methods are pure of any network/SDK dependency and
are what the offline tests exercise directly; ``aiohttp``/``fastmcp`` are
lazy-imported so importing this module stays cheap and Docker-free.
