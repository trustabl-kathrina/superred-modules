"""The DTAP environment-write vector: the concrete :class:`~dtap_scaffold.protocols.EnvInjector`.

DTAP's *environment* injection vector writes attacker-controlled data straight
into a live backend (an email into the mailbox, a comment onto a record, a file
onto the shared volume) via dedicated ``<server>-injection`` MCP servers whose
only tools are write-only ``inject_*`` calls (see
``dt_arena/injection_mcp_server/<domain>/env_injection.py`` upstream). The agent
then encounters that data later through its ordinary env tools -- an indirect
prompt injection that lands in the world, not just in a single tool return.

:class:`McpEnvInjector` is what the agent-agnostic base calls for the per-server
``env_inject`` PostCall controllable:

- :meth:`snapshot` supplies the PostCall event's genuine ``answer``. The injection
  servers expose no read tool, so there is no genuine backend content to read
  through this vector; it returns ``""`` (best-effort). The agent observes any
  injected data later through its normal env tools (the proxy's ``env_tool`` path).
- :meth:`apply` takes the optimizer's injected value and executes the actual
  ``inject_*`` MCP call against ``injection_server_urls[point.server]``. The value
  is the structured ``{"injection_mcp_tool": "<server>:<tool>", "kwargs": {...}}``
  form (a list of these is also accepted for several writes), matching upstream
  ``get_env_injections_from_attack`` / ``apply_environment_injections_async``.

The fastmcp client call is isolated in :meth:`_call`, the seam offline tests
monkeypatch, so no network or ``fastmcp`` import happens under test.
