"""Controllables exposed by the DTAP agent targets (shared by both agents).

These are the attacker-facing injection points. The target ALWAYS fires the
corresponding event; the Controller's ``security_domain_filter`` decides, per the
experiment's scope, whether an optimizer may actually inject. A passthrough
optimizer (declines everything) leaves every value genuine, reproducing DTAP's
unattacked run -- the clean baseline. The byte-identical upstream attack payloads
are NOT defaults here; a real attack is whatever the optimizer injects at runtime
(there is no built-in replay of the upstream ``attack_turns`` through these
controllables -- the clean baseline carries no attack).

The four DTAP injection vectors map to these controllables:

- prompt      -> ``user_prompt``                       (USER, PreCall)
- skill       -> ``skill``                             (SKILL, PreCall)
- tool        -> ``tool_description_override`` /       (TOOL_CATALOGUE_EDIT, PreCall;
                 ``tool_description_suffix``             applied in the proxy list_tools)
- environment -> ``env_inject:<server>``               (environment.<server>, PostCall,
                 (one per injection server)             one per injection server; writes
                                                        attacker data to the live backend)

Plus four anonframework-afforded surfaces DTAP does not itself enumerate as vectors:

- ``system_prompt``                                    (SYSTEM_PROMPT, PreCall; overrides
                                                        the agent's system message)
- ``env_tool:<server>.<node>``                         (tools.<server>.<node>, PostCall, one
                                                        per authorization node per active env
                                                        server; replaces what a tool at that
                                                        node returns. ``env_tool:<server>`` is
                                                        the root/fallback surface)
- ``filesystem``                                       (host_filesystem, PreCall; the
                                                        attacker places/edits/deletes files
                                                        on the target machine before the run)
- ``code_execution``                                   (host_code_execution, PostCall loop;
                                                        the attacker runs code on the target
                                                        machine, repeatedly, until it stops)

Native agent tools (bash/edit/exec/fs) run inside the agent container and are
observable-only (see ``observables.AGENT_TRACE_TOOL_CALLS_TAG``): those are the
agent's OWN tool calls, an observation surface. ``filesystem`` and
``code_execution`` are the ATTACKER's own write/execute access to that same
machine (the ``host`` trust boundary), so they are Controllables, not
observations. Both are additive: a passthrough optimizer places no files and runs
no code, so the machine is exactly what DTAP would run.
