"""Observables exposed by the DTAP agent targets (shared by both agents).

Static observables are returned from ``get_observables`` (read once at init);
dynamic observables are emitted live on the trajectory during ``run`` via
``emit(ObservableEvent(observable=..., content=...))``.

Emit-once discipline: an MCP env tool's call+return is emitted exactly once, on
its server's ``env_tool:<server>`` ``ControllablePostCallEvent`` (the specific
tool + params ride in the event's ``request``; see ``controllables``), NOT
mirrored here. Only the agent's NATIVE tool calls and its non-tool messages come
from the in-container transcript, each emitted once. The trajectory extractor
SKIPS proxied tool entries so they are not double-counted.
