"""Byte-faithful out-of-band (OOB) runner for the DecodingTrust-Agent judge.

DTAP ships per-task graders as ``<task_dir>/judge.py`` files exposing a ``Judge``
class with ``eval_task`` / ``eval_attack``. The upstream harness grades a run by
calling :func:`utils.judge_helpers.run_judge` (from the installed
``decodingtrust-agent-sdk``), which dynamically imports that ``judge.py`` and
returns a verdict dict. Many DTAP judges are *verifiable*: they re-query the
LIVE environment over HTTP, reading per-instance container host ports from
process environment variables; some judges additionally call an LLM through
``utils.llm.call_llm``.

This module runs that upstream ``run_judge`` **unchanged** in a child process so
that the per-instance state can be wired through the child's environment without
polluting (or being polluted by) the parent:

* every ``env_ports`` entry is exported as ``VAR=port`` so the verifiable judges
  reach *this* instance's containers;
* ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` / ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` are set to the judge endpoint so the
  LLM-judge path (``utils.llm`` -> ``OpenAI()``) talks to the experiment proxy;
* ``JUDGE_MODEL`` selects the judge model (default
  :data:`DEFAULT_JUDGE_MODEL`).

The judge's token spend is therefore **out of band** -- it never goes through
the optimizer's ``LLMClient`` and is not counted against the optimizer budget,
exactly like a target's own inference.

Faithfulness notes
------------------
* **Judge call.** The upstream harness grades the *final* response
  (``eval/task_runner.py:374`` calls ``run_judge(task_dir, response=final_output,
  trajectory=...)``); ``run_judge`` wraps a ``str`` into ``[response]`` as the
  judge's ``agent_responses``. We mirror that exactly: ``response=final_response``.
  The full per-turn list (``agent_responses``) is accepted for interface
  parity with the scaffold query surface but is not forwarded; judges that need
  the whole run read it from ``trajectory_json`` (the standardized DTAP-schema
  trace), which IS forwarded.
* **Judge model (the one permitted judge substitution).** ``utils/llm.py`` takes
  the model as a function argument and reads no model env var; the only judge-
  model env var upstream is ``JUDGE_MODEL`` (consulted ONLY by the
  customer_service domain). Every other domain's per-task judge calls
  ``super().__init__(domain=...)`` and so inherits ``BaseJudge``'s *placeholder*
  default ``"gpt-5.4"`` -- a name the proxy does not serve, so those LLM judges
  would fail and mis-score ``attack_success`` as ``False``. The child therefore
  rewrites ONLY that default (:func:`_install_judge_model_override`, run before any
  judge) to the configured ``JUDGE_MODEL``, leaving every judge's LOGIC
  byte-identical. Judges import ``BaseJudge`` as either ``from
  dt_arena.src.types.judge import BaseJudge`` or ``from judge import BaseJudge``,
  so the override unifies both onto one patched class. ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` /
  ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` still route the endpoint; the caller supplies a
  ``JUDGE_MODEL`` the endpoint actually serves (``utils.llm.call_llm`` keeps the
  temperature path for non-``gpt-5`` models and drops it for ``gpt-5*``, so the
  substitute works either way). A THIRD LLM-judge seam is the ``research`` harm
  scorer (``dt_arena/utils/research/helpers.gpt_score_report``), a standalone
  ``urllib`` POST that reads ``OPENAI_MODEL`` (default ``"gpt-5.1"``) rather than
  ``BaseJudge`` / ``JUDGE_MODEL``; the child therefore ALSO exports
  ``OPENAI_MODEL`` = the configured judge model, or every research LLM judge would
  request the unserved placeholder and silently mis-score ``attack_success`` as
  ``False``.
* **Hardcoded endpoints (redirected, not edited).** The benign customer_service
  judges ``urllib``-post directly to ``https://api.openai.com`` and ignore
  ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``, so a proxy-only key would 401 there and mis-score utility as
  ``0``. :func:`_install_openai_endpoint_redirect` (installed in the child before any
  judge runs) rewrites ONLY that origin onto the ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` proxy origin,
  keeping the request path, model, and parsing byte-identical -- the SAME judge call
  reaches the experiment proxy instead of OpenAI directly. This is an endpoint
  substitution, the twin of the model-default substitution, never a judge-logic
  change; the ``research`` judges and the OpenAI-client / ``BaseJudge`` judges already
  honor ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` and route to the proxy, so the rewrite is a no-op for them
  (their URLs never start with ``api.openai.com``). No upstream file is edited; nothing
  is sent to OpenAI directly.
* **Upstream utility imports.** Workflow judges import ``slack.helpers`` and
  ``gmail.helpers`` as top-level packages. In the SDK wheel those packages are
  installed as ``dt_arena.utils.slack`` and ``dt_arena.utils.gmail``, and
  ``utils.judge_helpers`` exposes neither top-level name. Before dynamically
  loading a judge, the child (:func:`_install_upstream_utility_aliases`) aliases
  only those two installed packages into ``sys.modules``. It intentionally does
  not expose the whole ``dt_arena/utils`` directory on ``sys.path``, because
  sibling package names such as ``calendar`` would shadow Python
  standard-library modules.
