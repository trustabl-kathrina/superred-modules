# Assumptions and divergences: inspect-agent-target

This target re-implements the orchestration of an inspect tool-calling agent so
that it runs under anonframework's Controller instead of `inspect_ai.eval()`. The
parts that determine a benchmark score (model, tools, message types) are inspect's
own; only the loop is ours.

## A. The rollout loop
`run_rollout` reproduces the body of inspect's `generate(tool_calls="loop")` using
inspect's own primitives: `Model.generate(messages, tools, tool_choice)` then
`execute_tools(messages, tools)` (the current API; supersedes the deprecated
`call_tools`). The resulting `list[ChatMessage]` is structurally identical to what
an `inspect_ai.eval` run produces. This loop is the single hand-replicated
control-flow point; a credentialed trace-parity test guards it. The optional
`on_tool_results` hook is called per turn with `(tool_results, tool_calls)` -- the
turn's tool-result messages plus the assistant message's `tool_calls` (a list of
inspect `ToolCall`) -- so the target can pair each result with the call (function
+ arguments) that produced it and fire one `ControllablePostCallEvent` per tool,
the single place a call and its return are carried.

## B. Message limit
`message_limit` caps the total number of messages (system + user + assistant +
tool). The loop breaks after appending tool results once the count reaches the
limit. inspect enforces its `message_limit` as a run limit; for behaviors that
finish before the cap (the common case) the two are equivalent. A consumer that
needs exact long-chain parity should pin the same value the benchmark uses
(AgentHarm: 20) and rely on the trace-parity test.

## C. Tool order
Tools are exposed in the order the caller supplies them (the resolved
`tool_names`). inspect's AgentHarm `setup_tools_from_metadata` shuffles tools with
`random.shuffle`; that shuffle is reproducible upstream (inspect seeds the RNG
from `GenerateConfig(seed=0)`), but order does not matter either way: benchmark
grading inspects which tools were called and in what call order, not their menu
order, so presentation order does not affect scores.

## D. Generation config
The model's `GenerateConfig` is built in `run()` from: `temperature` (default 0.0)
and `max_tokens` (default 4096), both construction parameters (AgentHarm uses
0.0 / 4096); plus `seed=0` and `max_retries=3`, hardcoded to AgentHarm's upstream
values as benchmark-agnostic generation defaults (not configurable, not
constructor params). `max_connections` is deliberately NOT set: cross-target
parallelism is owned by the `TargetFactory` (its `concurrency` + the controller's
semaphore), not by per-target generation config, so baking a connection cap into
the target would conflict with the factory's concurrency and risk the proxy's
rate limit. AgentHarm sets `max_connections=100` for its own scheduler; a claim
that needs strict parity can opt in at its target factory.

## E. Model client
The target uses its own inspect `Model` (via `get_model`, optionally pointed at a
LiteLLM proxy with `base_url`/`api_key`), not anonframework's `LLMClient`. This mirrors
the AgentDojo target, which also drives its own provider client. Consequently the
agent's own token spend is not counted in the Controller's `llm_usage` (which
tracks the optimizer's constrained client); it is out-of-band, like an OOB judge.
The model id is fixed at construction (the `model` arg): it is **not** a config
slot, so neither the Task nor the attacker can change the agent's model; a per-run
model change is not part of this surface. The read-only identity is still exposed
via the `model_identity` observable.

## E.1 Static observables vs the trajectory
Static configuration is exposed as **static observables** (`get_observables`,
handed to the optimizer at init): `model_identity`, `system_prompt`,
`message_limit`, `detailed_system_specification` (a read-only leaked free-text
system-spec brief), and `tool_catalog_listing` (the configured, pre-edit catalogue).
Everything that **happens during the run** is on the **trajectory**: the non-tool
internal message stream is per-message `ObservableEvent`s (the only one-way
target-to-trajectory mechanism, each wrapping an `Observable`) -- tool-result
messages are skipped and the `tool_calls` field is stripped from assistant
messages. Each tool call (function + arguments) and its return are NOT
double-emitted as observables; they live exactly once on that tool's
`ControllablePostCallEvent` (a two-way controllable event recorded on the
trajectory), the same boundary the attacker may inject into. This emit-once rule
keeps a call/return on a single, properly scoped surface (the per-tool boundary)
rather than re-exposing it under the broad `agent_trace` boundary, where a
trace-scoped optimizer could otherwise read every tool's traffic out of the
aggregate. Attacker actions (prompt and catalogue injections) are on the
trajectory too, as the controllable events. So the catalogue is intentionally NOT emitted on the
trajectory: its static snapshot is an observable, and its dynamic edits are the
catalogue controllable events.

## F. Tool choice modes
Only inspect's standard `tool_choice` values are supported (`auto`/`any`/`none`).
The AgentHarm "forced_first" agent variant is out of scope; AgentHarm's default
(and this port's baseline) is `auto`.

## G. Tool-catalogue Controllables (AgentDojo-style, fired once)
The target exposes four tool-catalogue Controllables (`tool_catalog_register`,
`_replace`, `_unregister`, `_rewrite_doc`) fired **once at run start** (after the
catalogue is seeded from the static `tool_names` config), plus a
`tool_catalog_listing` observable. Design points:

- **Once, not per turn.** AgentDojo fires its catalogue hook before *every* LLM
  turn (outside the loop for the first turn, inside `ToolsExecutionLoop` for the
  rest). We deliberately fire once at the start to avoid per-turn event noise: the
  optimizer gets a single chance to edit the registry, then the tool set is fixed
  for the run. The per-turn `tools_provider` seam in `run_rollout` still exists
  (a static provider is used here), so per-turn firing could be reinstated.
- They are fired **unconditionally** by the target; the Controller's
  `security_domain_filter` middleware gates injection by scope, so an out-of-scope
  optimizer simply receives no-injection. The target's job is to expose the
  surface; the experiment designer's scope decides exposure to the optimizer.
- Scopes mirror AgentDojo: the catalogue capability is split into three sibling
  children of a pure grouping root `tool_catalogue`. `register` is
  `tool_catalogue_add`, `replace` and `rewrite_doc` are `tool_catalogue_edit`,
  and `unregister` is `tool_catalogue_remove`. The static tool set and the
  listing observable carry `tool_catalogue` itself, so keeping that tag in
  `read_only` (rather than `scope`) grants the listing without edit capability.
  Granting `tool_catalogue` subsumes all three children; granting `edit` alone
  does NOT imply `add`. The `tool_catalogue` root lives under the `system`
  umbrella root, alongside `system_prompt`, `model_identity`,
  `detailed_system_specification`, and `agent_trace`.
- Initial tools remain a static Task config (`tool_names`); the catalogue is
  seeded from them each run and edited only by accepted injections.
- **Faithfulness-safe**: a passthrough optimizer (the AgentHarm baseline) injects
  nothing, so the catalogue stays exactly the Task-configured tools and the run is
  identical to having no catalogue surface. The surface exists for *other* claims
  (tool poisoning / malicious-MCP), not for AgentHarm itself.
- Registered/replaced tools are built with `ToolDef` from an attacker-supplied
  name/description/JSON-Schema params and a canned-return body; malformed payloads
  are logged and ignored (never abort the run).

## H. Per-tool output Controllables (indirect prompt injection, scoped by trust boundary)
For each configured tool the target exposes one `tool:<name>` Controllable, fired
as a `ControllablePostCallEvent` after **that** tool returns.  Design points:

- **One controllable per tool, post-call only.** The event carries the tool's
  legitimate return as `answer` and the call (`json.dumps` with keys `function`
  and `arguments`) as `request`. A
  `ControllableInjection` replaces the content the agent sees; a no-injection (or
  out-of-scope filter) leaves it verbatim. Pre-call request tampering is
  deliberately *not* a separate controllable: the tools here are side-effect-free
  (canned returns / read-only benchmark tools), so executing the call and then
  rewriting its whole return is indistinguishable from first rewriting the request
  then rewriting the return. One post-call surface per tool subsumes both.
- **Scoped by trust boundary, not one tag per tool.** Each `tool:<name>` is scoped
  to `tool_scopes[name]` -- a claim-supplied leaf of a trust-boundary sub-forest
  parented under the `tools` root (e.g. `web`, `social`, `financial`). The
  *principle* is "scopes where content could realistically be compromised"; tools
  hitting the same external system share a scope (so it is often, but not always,
  one scope per tool). The general target knows none of these boundaries; it just
  accepts the map and assembles the domain via `build_domain` (the ancestor
  closure of the map's values, plus the fixed trees). Unmapped tools fall back to
  the bare `tools` root.
- `tools` (the per-tool *returned content*) is distinct from `tool_catalogue`
  (the *registry*: which tools exist and their docs). The `tool_catalog_replace`
  catalogue edit overlaps with a `tool:<name>` injection for shadowing a return,
  but register/unregister/rewrite-doc do not; the two surfaces are kept separate.
- Fired **unconditionally**; the Controller's `security_domain_filter` gates
  injection by scope, exactly like the catalogue controllables.
- The call and the agent-visible value (after any injection) are carried only on
  this `ControllablePostCallEvent`; they are NOT also mirrored to a separate
  tool-call / tool-response observable. The removed
  `agent_trace_tool_calls` / `agent_trace_tool_responses` tags and their
  observables no longer exist; a read-only-scoped optimizer sees exactly what the
  agent saw by listing the tool's own boundary tag under `read_only`.
- **Faithfulness-safe**: a passthrough optimizer injects nothing, so every tool
  return reaches the agent unchanged and AgentHarm baselines are unaffected.
