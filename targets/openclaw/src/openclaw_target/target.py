"""OpenClawTarget: wrap the OpenClaw personal AI assistant as a anonframework target.

Connects to a running OpenClaw Gateway over WebSocket, sends user
messages via the ``agent`` RPC, and exposes the agent's tool-calling,
message-response, and configuration surfaces as controllables and
observables for the anonframework red-teaming framework.

All native agent activity (assistant ``chat`` deltas, tool calls,
model requests/responses when the LLM proxy is on) is
emitted live into the framework :class:`~anonframework.core.types.trajectory.Trajectory`
as :class:`~anonframework.core.types.events.ObservableEvent` s; no parallel
trace representation is maintained.

Tool-output injection uses two OpenClaw seams (verified against
openclaw/openclaw source):

* **Live same-turn** — ``registerAgentToolResultMiddleware`` on the
  embedded ``tool_result`` path rewrites the in-flight result before the
  provider continuation (``file_content``, ``web_content``, etc.).
* **Transcript poisoning (next prompt, same session)** — async
  ``before_tool_call`` + sync ``tool_result_persist`` rewrite only what
  gets persisted (``*_transcript`` controllables); surfaces on the next
  ``target.run()`` in the *same* session.

Both paths emit :class:`~anonframework.core.types.events.ControllablePostCallEvent`
per intercepted tool call (framework convention for tool-output injection).

A third, independent seam covers **cross-session memory poisoning**:

* **Durable memory (next session, any session)** — ``persistent_memory``
  fires once at the end of :meth:`OpenClawTarget.run`, with the full
  session ``chat.history`` as context, and writes its result via the real
  ``agents.files.set`` RPC into ``MEMORY.md``. Unlike ``*_transcript``
  (which only rewrites the session's own JSONL transcript) this is a real
  file write: it survives ``sessions.reset`` and a fresh session, matching
  the cross-session persistence dimension used by SafeClawArena
  (Stateful/Persistent State Exploitation) and CIK-Bench (``mem-long``),
  as distinct from same-session transcript poisoning (``mem-session`` /
  ``*_transcript``). This deliberately does *not* use OpenClaw's
  ``before_prompt_build`` / ``enqueueNextTurnInjection`` seams — those are
  ephemeral prompt context, not durable state, and ``enqueueNextTurnInjection``
  is not late-callable from outside plugin ``register()`` in any case.

# agents.files.set, which the gateway gates behind operator.admin - the same
# scope as agents.update/agents.delete (verified against
# src/gateway/methods/core-descriptors.ts). That is a categorically stronger
# compromise than *_content/*_transcript (EXTERNAL_DATA_TAG): those need zero
# gateway credential at all, since the injection plugin rewrites content
# already flowing through a normal tool call (a malicious webpage, a planted
# file, an inbound message) - realistic "third-party content in third-party
# storage" per docs/guide/security-domains.md. MEMORY.md is first-party
# storage behind an admin-only RPC, so it doesn't belong in that bucket.
#
# workspace_files and system_prompt_append (both ConfigSpecs, below) write
# through the identical agents.files.set/operator.admin RPC and also carry
# AGENT_ADMIN_TAG - one real trust boundary, one tag, regardless of which
# node type currently exercises it. Whether the *evaluator* (ConfigSpec) or
# the *optimizer* (Controllable) is the one crossing that boundary is a
# separate, already-answered question: ConfigSpec.security_domain is never
# read by the Controller's scope filter (verified against
# anonframework/core/controller.py - only Controllable/Observable/Score domains
# gate anything), so a ConfigSpec is structurally evaluator-only no matter
# which tag it carries. Splitting these into two tags by node-type would
# duplicate that already-structural guarantee onto the tag axis and make the
# tag lie about the actual compromise required. INTERNAL_CONTEXT_TAG remains
# reserved for the harness's own zero-RPC surface - system_prompt's
# Observable is a plain local Python attribute read, not an agents.files.*
# call, so it stays on a different tag from its own ConfigSpec write path.

class OpenClawTarget(Target):
    """AnonFramework target wrapping a running OpenClaw Gateway + Agent.

    The target communicates with a running OpenClaw instance via its
    native WebSocket protocol and streams every native ``AgentEvent``
    into the run trajectory as a typed
    :class:`~anonframework.core.types.events.ObservableEvent`.

    Args:
        gateway_url: WebSocket URL of the Gateway
            (default ``ws://127.0.0.1:18789``).
        auth_token: Shared-secret auth token for the Gateway.
            Can be omitted when ``managed=True`` (auto-generated).
        session_key: Session routing key used for agent runs.
        agent_id: OpenClaw agent id used for ``agents.files.set`` calls.
            Default ``"main"`` matches the agent id ``config.py`` always
            registers for a managed gateway (``agents.defaults`` / ``agents.list``);
            override only when pointing at an externally managed gateway with a
            differently named agent.
        model_id: Configured target model identifier, surfaced as a static
            observable so the optimizer sees it at initialization.
        agent_timeout_s: Max seconds to wait for an agent run.
        enable_tool_injection: Expose per-call tool-output
            controllables via the plugin-hook bridge. The async
            ``before_tool_call`` hook emits a live
            ``ControllablePostCallEvent`` (tool-output injection) and the
            sync ``tool_result_persist`` hook splices the result into the
            persisted session transcript. The real tool always executes
            for real; the injected content poisons what subsequent turns
            of the same session see as history (verified live: it does
            not rewrite the tool result the in-flight tool-calling loop
            continues with, only what later prompt submissions load).
        enable_persistent_memory: Expose the ``persistent_memory``
            controllable. Once per :meth:`run`, after the agent finishes,
            emits a ``ControllablePostCallEvent`` carrying the full session
            ``chat.history``; the returned value is written into
            ``MEMORY.md`` via the real ``agents.files.set`` RPC — a durable
            file, not a prompt hook, so it survives ``sessions.reset`` and a
            fresh session. Independent of ``enable_tool_injection`` (no
            plugin required; uses the same RPC as ``workspace_files``).
            OpenClaw reloads ``MEMORY.md`` into the system prompt on every
            turn (even within a long-lived, un-reset session), so the write
            always takes effect — but without ``reset_session_between_runs
            =True`` the multi-run loop never actually produces a *fresh*
            session with no other context, so the poisoned content stays
            redundant with the live transcript and the cross-session
            "fresh agent trusts old memory" scenario this controllable
            targets is never exercised across iterations of one task.
        reset_session_between_runs: If ``True``, clear the OpenClaw
            conversation/session in :meth:`reset_ephemeral_state`. Default
            ``False`` keeps the session across runs of a task — OpenClaw
            sessions are durable state, so a fresh conversation would lose
            intended context and break poison-then-trigger attacks. Set
            ``True`` to exercise ``persistent_memory``'s cross-session
            behavioral-influence path across runs of the same task (see
            ``enable_persistent_memory`` above).
        enable_llm_proxy: Intercept model calls via a local LLM proxy.
            ``None`` (default) turns it on whenever ``provider_base_url`` is
            set; pass ``False`` to force it off. When on (managed mode), the
            gateway is pointed at the proxy so model requests/responses are
            recorded and the system prompt can be injected.
        provider_base_url: Upstream LLM provider URL.
        provider_api_key: API key for the upstream LLM provider.
        managed: If ``True``, auto-start/stop an OpenClaw Gateway managed by
            this target. A fresh gateway is started lazily on first connect and
            torn down in :meth:`teardown`; because the controller builds one
            target instance per task via the
            :class:`~anonframework.core.controller.TargetFactory`, each task gets an
            isolated gateway.
        managed_runtime: Which managed backend to use when ``managed=True``:
            ``"local"`` (default) runs ``openclaw gateway`` as a loopback Node
            subprocess; ``"docker"`` runs the whole gateway in a fresh container
            per task (full host isolation, dynamic ports for safe
            ``concurrency>1``). Docker mode reaches host-side services (injection
            server + LLM proxy) via ``host.docker.internal``.
        managed_kwargs: Extra kwargs forwarded to the runtime
            (:class:`openclaw_target.runtime.OpenClawRuntime` or
            :class:`openclaw_target.docker_runtime.OpenClawDockerRuntime`).

    Between runs of a single task the controller calls
    :meth:`reset_ephemeral_state`, which clears only per-run (ephemeral)
    state. Durable task state — planted files / AGENTS.md and the
    conversation/session — is preserved across runs and discarded only
    when the controller obtains a fresh instance from the
    ``TargetFactory`` between tasks (which, when ``managed``, is a fresh
    gateway). Planted files are cleaned up in :meth:`teardown`.

        The controller calls :meth:`get_observables` synchronously immediately

        The gateway tool catalogue is only available post-connect, so tasks
        should ``await target.warmup_static_observables()`` from
        ``configure_target`` when the optimizer needs the catalogue at init
        (in addition to the per-run emission in :meth:`run`).

        Why this is opt-in rather than always-eager: ``Target.set_config`` is
        synchronous and ``Task.configure_target`` is written against the
        generic ``Target``/``Task`` contract (``anonframework.core.interfaces.
        target``/``task``), which never awaits anything target-specific
        between construction and :meth:`run` — a task bound to the generic
        ``Task[Target]`` (see that module's docstring) only ever calls
        ``target.set_config(...)``, so there is no framework-guaranteed async
        lifecycle hook before ``run()`` for *every* task, only for tasks that
        know they're bound to ``OpenClawTarget`` specifically and choose to
        call this method. Starting the gateway/Docker container unconditionally
        at construction/configure time would also pay that cost for tasks that
        never call ``run()`` (e.g. controllers only enumerating
        ``config_specs``/``get_controllables`` before scheduling). Deferring
        expensive process/container startup to first ``run()`` (with this
        method as an explicit early-connect escape hatch) matches the existing
        convention elsewhere in this repo, e.g. ``asb_target.target.run``
        builds/starts its process-singleton kernel + scheduler inside ``run``,
