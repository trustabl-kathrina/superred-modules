"""Attacker-controlled injection surfaces for the LlamaIndex agent target.

A anonframework agent target must expose the agent's real attack surfaces, not just
the user prompt. Besides ``user_input`` (a direct message), an agent is attackable
through:

- **tool returns** — content a tool hands back that the agent then reads and acts
  on (indirect prompt injection: the classic agent vector), and
- **its system prompt** — instructions an attacker manages to plant in the
  agent's own system message.

A ``ReActAgent`` bakes its tools and system prompt in at construction time, so the
target builds the agent *per run* and hands the factory an :class:`InjectionSpec`
carrying the current run's injected values: the factory appends the system-prompt
text (via the ReActAgent's ``system_prompt`` parameter, which the ReAct formatter
folds into the system header) and wraps each tool via :meth:`InjectionSpec.wrap_tools`
so every tool's returned ``ToolOutput`` carries the attacker payload the agent
reads back. An optimizer's surface classifier then chooses which of these named
surfaces to drive; left un-injected, the spec is empty and the agent runs unchanged.

The framework is imported **lazily** (inside the wrapping helpers, never at module
top) so this module — and the target that imports it — stays importable without
``llama-index`` installed.
