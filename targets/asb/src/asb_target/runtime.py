"""ASB runtime bridge: a self-contained scheduler and an event-interposing
agent subclass.

ASB drives its agent through an ``LLMRequestQueue`` consumed by a background
``FIFOScheduler`` thread. Upstream that queue is a CLASS attribute and the LLM
a process singleton, which makes two ASB runtimes in one process silently
wrong: a queued request names no model, so whichever scheduler pops it answers
with ITS model, and provider failures land in one shared list that cannot say
which run they belong to. :class:`AsbRuntime` moves all of it (queue,
scheduler, LLM, credentials, failure record) onto an instance, so a anonframework
``AsbTarget`` owns exactly one and any number of targets run concurrently
without interfering. :func:`new_asb_runtime` builds and starts one; the LLM is
routed through the litellm proxy via :mod:`asb_target.llm_proxy`. See
ASSUMPTIONS.md G.1.

:class:`AnonFrameworkReactAgent` re-implements ASB's plan-then-execute ``run`` with
the four injection sites driven by anonframework ``ControllablePreCallEvent`` s
instead of ASB's argparse flags, and with the agent's genuine generations
emitted once each as provenance-tagged ``ObservableEvent`` s. The agent loop
itself (plan format, step prompts, simulated-tool execution, the attacker-tool
simulated return) is reproduced verbatim from ``ReactAgentAttack`` so behaviour
and success strings are unchanged. The target performs NO injection by
default: with no attacker every site declines and the run is a clean,
upstream-faithful baseline. There is no defense or manual-mode code (bare
runtime). See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md``.
