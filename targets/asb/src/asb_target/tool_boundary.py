Each ASB normal tool is its own backing system, so OPI on that tool's
observation fires tagged to the tool's own ``tools.<name>`` leaf. Unknown
tools, and the per-task attacker tool (which is not a fixed backing system),
fire at the ``tools`` root. This is a mechanical lookup over
:data:`asb_target.security_tags.TOOL_OBSERVATION_TAGS`, with no hand-authored
grouping: the upstream-faithful, provenance-blind OPI scope is simply
``{tools}`` (the root subsumes every leaf).
