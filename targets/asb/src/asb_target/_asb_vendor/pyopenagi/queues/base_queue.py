    """A request queue, owned by one runtime.

    anonframework port deviation (ASSUMPTIONS.md G.1). Upstream held ``_queue`` as a
    CLASS attribute with classmethod put/get, so every agent and scheduler in a
    process shared one queue. A queued request names no model, so with two
    runtimes alive whichever scheduler popped a request answered it with ITS
    kernel's model: silent cross-talk. One queue per runtime removes that.

    ``on_unservable`` is called with any message this queue can never serve.
    It is not optional cleanup: a request has no timeout (``BaseAgent.listen``
    spins until a response appears), so a message left in a queue whose
    scheduler has stopped hangs its caller for the life of the process.
