"""Durable agent memory: a lightweight, faithful substitute for ASB's
Chroma vector store.

Upstream ASB gives its agent a persistent vector store (``langchain_chroma``
``Chroma`` with OpenAI embeddings). During a *write* run the agent appends a
record of its own work (``Agent: ...; Task: ...; Workflow: ...; Tools: ...``);
during a *read* run it retrieves the single most similar prior record
(``similarity_search_with_score``, top-1) and is told to follow that
"previous workflow". This is the substrate the memory-poisoning attack
corrupts.

This module reproduces that mechanism without the heavy ``chromadb`` /
``langchain`` dependency stack: it embeds text through the same
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (the experiment's LiteLLM proxy, via the already
present :mod:`litellm`) and retrieves the top-1 document by cosine
similarity. Embeddings are identical to upstream's (same model, same proxy)
and top-1 retrieval is metric-robust for the small per-task corpora the
framework produces, so the retrieved content (hence the agent's behaviour)
is faithful. See ``ASSUMPTIONS.md`` for the documented divergences
(in-process top-1 cosine in place of Chroma; per-task store in place of
upstream's suite-level persisted database).

The store is held as **durable** state on the target: it survives
``reset_ephemeral_state`` (the per-run reset) so an attacker can poison it in
one run and exploit it in a later run of the same task, and it is discarded
only when the controller obtains a fresh target from the factory between
tasks.

A failed embedding call raises loudly; it is never swallowed into agent
state, so a dead or misconfigured endpoint cannot silently contaminate a run.
