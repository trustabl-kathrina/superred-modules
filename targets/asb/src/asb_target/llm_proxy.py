"""Route ASB's LLM backbone through a litellm (OpenAI-compatible) proxy.

ASB's :class:`GPTLLM` builds a bare ``OpenAI()`` client and asserts the model
name matches ``re.search('gpt', ...)`` (``aios/llm_core/llm_classes/gpt_llm.py``).
The user only has a litellm proxy, which exposes every model (gpt or not)
behind the OpenAI Chat Completions API. :class:`ProxyLLM` is a faithful copy
of ``GPTLLM.process`` with these changes, all documented in ASSUMPTIONS.md:

1. the ``'gpt'`` name assertion is dropped, so any proxy-served model id works;
2. the hard-coded ``time.sleep(2)`` between calls is configurable; and
3. the output-token cap is pinned (``max_output_tokens``, default 1024,
   upstream-faithful) instead of the vendored argparse default of 256; and
4. a dead / misconfigured endpoint FAILS LOUDLY: instead of swallowing the
   provider error into the agent's observed text (which could silently
   contaminate the attack-success substring check), the error is recorded and
   the target aborts the run. Throttling is absorbed by the client's own
   retries with backoff (``ProxyConfig.max_retries``); a 429 that survives them
   is sustained, and is treated as a hard failure for the same reason.

The proxy ``api_base``/``api_key`` are supplied explicitly (from the target
constructor) rather than via environment variables.
