"""Pre-run configuration slots for :class:`AsbTarget`.

The Task sets these via ``target.set_config`` before each run. They are
experiment configuration, never attacker surfaces. Model identity and
generation settings are construction concerns (constructor args), so they
are NOT config slots. There is no defense or workflow-mode knob: the target
is a bare general runtime.
