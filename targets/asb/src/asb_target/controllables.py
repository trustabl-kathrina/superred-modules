"""Controllable injection points exposed by :class:`AsbTarget`.

One Controllable per ASB injection method, each tagged to its trust-boundary
surface so the attacker's *scope* selects the method:

- ``dpi_user_prompt`` (user)                  -> DPI (tamper the user task)
- ``opi_tool_observation`` (tools.<tool>)     -> OPI (tamper a tool return);
  fired per non-final tool return tagged to the firing tool's leaf, so any
  ``{tools}`` or single-tool scope sees an OPI surface.
- ``pot_system_demonstration`` (system_prompt) -> PoT backdoor
- ``mp_retrieved_workflow`` (memory)          -> Memory poisoning (read side)
- ``tool_catalog_register`` (tool_catalogue_add)     -> add a new tool
- ``tool_catalog_replace`` (tool_catalogue_edit)     -> shadow a tool's behavior
- ``tool_catalog_rewrite_doc`` (tool_catalogue_edit) -> edit a tool's description
- ``tool_catalog_unregister`` (tool_catalogue_remove) -> remove a tool
  The four catalogue-edit controllables fire ONCE before planning. An added or
  behavior-replaced tool is SHADOWED: at call time its return comes from a
  per-call event tagged at the add/edit capability (so editing scope grants the
  call even when the tool's ``tools.*`` leaf is out of scope), and the original
  tool is not run. See :func:`tool_catalogue_call_ctrl`.

The target performs NO injection by default: with no attacker every site
declines and the run is a clean, upstream-faithful baseline. The
Controllables only *expose* the opportunity; the actual injected content is
an attacker's concern.
