"""Several ASB targets must be able to run CONCURRENTLY in one process.

Upstream ASB keeps the request queue on the class and the kernel on the
process, so two targets alive at once are silently wrong in two ways:

1. a queued request names no model, so whichever scheduler pops it answers
   with ITS kernel's model: one target's calls get served as the other
   target's model, and nothing in the record says so; and
2. provider failures accumulate in one shared list, so one target's dead
   endpoint aborts the other target's run.

Both are silent, which is what makes them dangerous: the numbers look fine.
These tests pin the fix (per-instance queue, scheduler, kernel and failure
record) by asserting the properties directly, and they FAIL against the
process-singleton design.

A third test covers what the fix costs us: with several runtimes sharing a
process, a scheduler thread that dies leaves its agent spinning in
``listen()`` forever, so the scheduler must survive a raising request.
