# anonframework-target-asb

Agent Security Bench (ASB) agent as a [anonframework](https://example.invalid)
`Target`.

> **Community port — not an official implementation.** This module is an
> unofficial re-implementation of Agent Security Bench (ASB) (Zhang et al., AGI
> Research) for anonframework. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained
> by the original authors. See [ASSUMPTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS.md) for every
> deliberate deviation from the paper and reference code.

This module runs ASB's real, vendored plan-then-execute agent loop (pinned to
upstream commit `1f561dcc`) against a litellm proxy. It is a bare runtime that
exposes the four ASB injection surfaces (DPI / OPI / PoT / MP) as anonframework
Controllables over a trust-boundary forest (roots: user, system, tools,
memory), restores ASB's durable memory store, and performs no injection by
default. The benchmark-specific data, grading, and tasks live in the paired
`anonframework-claim-asb` package.

The importable package name is `asb_target`:

```python
from asb_target import AsbTarget
```

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e "/path/to/anonframework-modules/targets/asb"
```
