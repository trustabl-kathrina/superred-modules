# anonframework-target-hackaprompt

A anonframework **Target** that runs one of the 11
[HackAPrompt](https://github.com/PromptLabs/hackaprompt) (Schulhoff et al., EMNLP
2023, arXiv:2311.16119) prompt-hijacking levels against the model under test. Each
level (0–10) is a **defended LLM application**: it wraps the attacker's
`user_input` in a level-specific instruction template (plus, for some levels, an
input filter, per-character escaping, or a two-step self-check), calls the model
via litellm, and captures the output the paired claim scores.

Pairs with [`anonframework-claim-hackaprompt`](../../security_claims/hackaprompt), whose
pure, deterministic judge decides whether the model emitted the target phrase
(`"I have been PWNED"`, or Level 2's per-run secret key).

## Usage

```python
from hackaprompt_claim import hackaprompt_claim
from hackaprompt_target import hackaprompt_target_factory

claim = hackaprompt_claim()                                  # 11 levels
target = hackaprompt_target_factory(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
# hand `claim` and `target` to the anonframework Controller with an attacker optimizer.
```

Knobs: `model` (defended LLM under test), `temperature` / `max_tokens` (upstream
ran temperature 0), and `seed` (make Level 2's secret key reproducible). The
target exposes one injection surface — `user_input` (the attacker's turn, scoped
to the untrusted-input boundary); a passthrough optimizer sends nothing and the
defense holds.

Level details preserved from upstream: Level 2 plants a **per-run** secret key
(re-armed each run so an attacker cannot memorize it across runs); Level 6 runs a
**two-step** defense (a story turn, then a self-check turn); Levels 7/9/10 apply
deterministic **input-filter** defenses (a word blocklist, a p-w-n-e-d letter ban,
and emoji-only) before the model runs.

## Provenance & faithfulness

The 11 level `format_prompt` templates and the input filters are ported
**byte-for-byte** from upstream `hackaprompt/evaluator.py` / `utils.py` (kept under
`_vendor/`, verified level-by-level against upstream). The per-level orchestration
is ported from upstream's `evaluate` bodies; the completer is replaced by litellm.
Deviations are in [`ASSUMPTIONS.md`](ASSUMPTIONS.md). MIT-licensed.

End-to-end runs call an LLM (the defended model); that path is not exercised in
unit tests, which cover the contract, the verbatim level defenses, and the full
run orchestration (win / filter-block / two-step / per-run key) with a stubbed
completer.
