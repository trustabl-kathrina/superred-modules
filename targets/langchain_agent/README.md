# anonframework-target-langchain-agent

An agent built on [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) (v1,
via `create_agent`) as a anonframework target — so red-team claims and optimizers can
drive a real LangChain agent graph.

The target exposes the agent's real attack surfaces as controllables, so an
optimizer's surface classifier can choose where to inject:

- `user_input` — a direct message to the agent (direct prompt injection);
- `tool_output` — attacker content appended to every tool's return value, i.e.
  the content a tool hands back that the agent then reads (indirect prompt
  injection via tool results — the classic agent vector);
- `system_prompt` — attacker text appended to the agent's own system prompt.

It then runs the compiled `create_agent` graph and captures its final output and
the tools it called (read back from the returned message list). The tool-call
signal is the security surface: an injection that makes the agent call a
sensitive tool it should not is the failure a paired claim scores. The
`tool_output` / `system_prompt` surfaces are wired through the agent factory via
an `InjectionSpec` (built per run) — see `injection.py` and `build_demo_agent`
for the reference wiring a caller's own factory should follow.

## What it adds, and what the offline test proves

The value is **realism/breadth**: it exercises the real LangChain v1 runtime —
the `create_agent` tool-calling graph and tool execution — the way a
widely-used agent framework actually behaves, so agentic red-team claims can
measure it directly.

Offline tests inject a **scripted `BaseChatModel`** (replaying pre-built
`AIMessage`s, optionally with `tool_calls`), so a real agent graph runs with no
network. Be precise about what that verifies: it proves the **plumbing** (input
delivery, tool-call capture, result mapping), not the security outcome — whether
the agent *follows* an injection is decided by a real model, which a live run
supplies.

A scripted model is **stateful** (it steps through its script per call), so the
target rewinds it at the start of each run. That per-instance counter is not
concurrency-safe: run a scripted model with `concurrency=1`. Real models are
stateless, so live runs have no such constraint.

## Usage

```python
from langchain_agent_target import langchain_agent_target_factory, build_demo_agent

factory = langchain_agent_target_factory(
    agent_factory=build_demo_agent,   # (model, injection_spec) -> create_agent(...) graph
    model="gpt-4o-mini",              # required: a model id string or a BaseChatModel
)
```

`agent_factory` is a callable `(model, injection_spec) -> compiled graph`: it
receives the chat model **and** the run's `InjectionSpec`, and returns a fresh
compiled `create_agent` graph. It owns the tools, and it must wire the spec so the
attack surfaces are live — feed the system prompt through
`injection_spec.apply_system_prompt(...)` (LangChain bakes it in at build time) and
pass `injection_spec.middleware()` to `create_agent` for the tool-return surface. A
factory that ignores the spec silently disables the `system_prompt` / `tool_output`
surfaces, and a one-argument factory raises `TypeError` at run time; see
`build_demo_agent` for the reference wiring. `model` is **required** — a
model id string or a configured `BaseChatModel`; LangChain's `create_agent` has no
default model. The target holds **no API key**: the model's auth is configured on
the `model` you supply, so no secret passes through this target. Config:
`user_task` (benign default input). Controllables: `user_input`, `tool_output`,
`system_prompt`.

## Queries

`last_response` (final assistant text), `tool_calls` (JSON of `{name, arguments}`),
`called_tool_names` (comma-separated, in order), `error`. Model/graph failures
(including the LangGraph recursion limit) are recorded in `error` (never raised),
so a claim can abstain.

The run **streams** state, so tool calls the agent already made are salvaged even
when the run then errors — e.g. a tool-call loop that hits the recursion limit
still reports the sensitive tool it called (it must not read as an empty,
"refused" run). Tool-call capture reads `AIMessage.tool_calls` from the returned
messages, which is what agents built from `create_agent` produce.

`last_response` is the `.text` of the last message (it flattens Claude/multimodal
content blocks to plain text). For a standard tool-calling agent the run ends on
the answer message; a factory using structured output (`response_format`) or
middleware that appends a trailing non-assistant message may leave `last_response`
empty — score `tool_calls` (the primary security surface) in that case. LangChain
guardrails are implemented as agent **middleware** — part of the agent your
factory builds — and manifest in the captured outcome (altered tools/output, or
an `error` if a middleware halts the run).
