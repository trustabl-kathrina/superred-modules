"""Attacker-controlled injection surfaces for the AG2 (AutoGen) agent target.

A anonframework agent target must expose the agent's real attack surfaces, not just
the user prompt. Besides ``user_input`` (a direct message), an AG2 agent is
attackable through:

- **tool returns** — content a tool hands back that the agent then reads and acts
  on (indirect prompt injection: the classic agent vector), and
- **its system prompt** — instructions an attacker manages to plant in the
  agent's own system message.

``ag2.Agent`` bakes its ``system_message`` and its tool set in at construction, so
the target builds the agent *per run* and hands the factory an
:class:`InjectionSpec` carrying this run's injected values: the factory appends the
system-prompt suffix to the agent's ``system_message``
(:meth:`InjectionSpec.apply_system_prompt`) and runs its tool callables through
:meth:`InjectionSpec.wrap_tools`, which wraps each so the appendix is appended to
whatever the tool returns. An optimizer's surface classifier then chooses which
named surface to drive; left un-injected, the spec is empty and the agent runs
unchanged.

This module imports **no** framework code: it wraps plain callables and edits plain
strings, so it (and the target that imports it) load even when ``ag2`` is not
installed — the framework is pulled in lazily only when an agent is actually
built/run.

    AG2 turns a tool's return value into the text the model reads back on its next
    turn, so the appendix must reach that text whatever *shape* the tool returns.
    This surface exists precisely to exercise that path, so **no return shape may
    silently drop the appendix** — the false-negative bug being: inject into ``str``
    only and skip every other shape (no error, no injection). Every shape is
    handled:

    - ``str``: the appendix is appended as trailing text.
    - ``Mapping`` (dict / JSON object): the appendix is attached under a dedicated
      note key — a non-clobbering key is chosen if it is already present — so it
      appears in the serialized object the model reads.
    - ``list`` / ``tuple`` (JSON array): the appendix is appended as an extra text
      element, preserving list-ness / tuple-ness.
    - any other JSON-able scalar (``int`` / ``float`` / ``bool`` / ``None``) or an
      arbitrary object: it cannot carry a note in-shape, so it is rendered to text
      with the appendix appended — the value still reaches the model, now carrying
      the injection, instead of being dropped.

    AG2 builds a tool's JSON schema from the callable's name, signature, and type
    hints. ``functools.wraps`` copies these for a plain function, but two gaps
    remain that this closes:

    - Annotations are copied as-is; under PEP 563 they are STRINGS resolvable only
      against the ORIGINAL tool's ``__globals__``, which this wrapper's module does
      not share, so a non-builtin annotation would ``NameError`` in AG2's schema
      builder. Resolve the hints against the tool's own globals and pin the concrete
      types on BOTH ``__annotations__`` and the pinned ``__signature__`` — a
      consumer may read either.
    - For a callable OBJECT (an instance whose ``__call__`` is the tool), ``wraps``
      can't copy ``__name__``/``__doc__`` (the instance has none); take the name
      from the class and read the signature/hints from ``__call__``.
