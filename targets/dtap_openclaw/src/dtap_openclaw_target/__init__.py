"""OpenClaw DTAP agent target for anonframework.

Public surface: :class:`DtapOpenClawTarget` (the concrete target). The
trajectory converter and the Docker driver are exposed too for custom
runners and tests; the security-domain tag constants come from
``dtap_scaffold`` (shared across both DTAP agent targets).
